During my tenure as tutor at Noroff vocational online school, I was tasked by
my team leader to recreate the Linux course -- part of the Network and System
Administration program -- in order to modernise it; make it more digestible for
students. The course I inherited, and went through myself as a student, was
getting crusty.

After close to **eleven months of continuous work**, I managed to create a
five-week-long course, for full-time studies, that consisted of purely
original:

- Written and video lectures
- Technical demonstration videos
- Lesson tasks and quizzes
- Test questions (automatic grading)
- Exam questions (short essay answers)

Students were highly satisfied with the end result, and my team leader approved
of the work. By the end of the course, the students should be capable of
running most Linux distributions at an intermediate level; based on an
intuitive understanding of the system, not rout memorisation.
