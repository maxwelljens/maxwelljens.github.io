My hobbies and passion are in programming, history, philosophy, and culture,
just to name a few. This is my website to publish posts for the world to read.
Occasionally I have programming projects, which you can check out on my GitHub.
If you have questions or want to come into contact with me for any other
reason, you may do so at <maxwelljensen@posteo.net>.

I do a blog, which you are viewing right now, where I post about various topics
from time to time. There are also these subdomains:

* [**docs.maxwelljensen.eu**](https://docs.maxwelljensen.eu)
  : ðŸ“˜ Documentation for my projects.
* [**bin.maxwelljensen.eu**](https://bin.maxwelljensen.eu)
  : ðŸ“‹ [microbin](https://github.com/szabodanika/microbin) instance for easy
text and file sharing.
