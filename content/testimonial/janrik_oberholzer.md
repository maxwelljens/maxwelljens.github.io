It is with great enthusiasm that I recommend Maxwell Jensen, an exceptional educator who
has made a positive impact on our Network and IT Security Administration program.
Maxwell joined Noroff as a student in 2021, where he distinguished himself through
dedication and excellence, earning his Professional Degree in Network and System
Administration.

Under Maxwellâ€™s leadership, the Linux course has become a favourite among students,
praised for its clarity, relevance, and accessibility. His ability to distil complex concepts into
engaging, student-friendly lessons reflects both his technical mastery and his commitment
to pedagogical excellence.
