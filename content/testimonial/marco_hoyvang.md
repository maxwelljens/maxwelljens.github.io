I started studying Network and System Administration through Noroff in January
2023, where I had the pleasure of meeting Maxwell Jensen. His dedication,
patience, and deep understanding of both the students and course material have
been truly inspiring.

I have had the privilege of being guided by him through academic standards and
the complexities of the Linux software space, which many students find
challenging. His support has been invaluable not only to me but to my
classmates as well, many of whom would have ultimately struggled or even failed
without his guidance.

Maxwell’s commitment to high standards is something that has stood out to all
of us, and his passion for helping others has been a refreshing and much-needed
change in the IT field. I can proudly and with a clear conscience say that
Maxwell Jensen has positively transformed how many students perceive IT,
allowing us to dive deeper into Linux and the field of IT as a whole.
