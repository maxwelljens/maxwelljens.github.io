Dynamic websites are websites that generate content on-the-fly, tailored to
each user's request. Unlike static websites, which serve the same page every
time someone visits, dynamic sites pull data from a database or other sources
to create unique pages for each visitor.

For example, when you visit a blog powered by WordPress, the site dynamically
pulls the latest posts, comments, and user information from its database to
display a personalised experience. This ability to change content in real-time
is why dynamic websites are used for e-commerce sites, social media platforms,
and other websites where user interaction and fresh content are essential.

However, for the vast majority of website concepts on the Internet, there is no
need for all of that complexity and dynamic processing. Presumably, you are
reading this guide in order to set up a personal blog, or some other simple
website to that effect. Consider the following diagram:

![Diagram showing the stupidity of dynamic websites for
blogs](/creating_a_website/dynamic_website_diagram.webp)

Clearly this makes sense for something like Facebook or a phpBB forum, but if
you are looking to set up a blog, then this is not the infrastructure to use.
Yet WordPress is used for this purpose all the time -- it's not at all
necessary.

On the other hand, static websites are essentially files (like HTML, CSS, and
images) stored on a server. When someone visits the website, their browser
requests these files over the Internet and displays them for the user. Since
there's no need for server-side processing, static sites load quickly and are
straightforward to maintain.

### Why a static site over something like WordPress?

One of the most compelling reasons to choose a static site generator is speed.
Unlike dynamic websites, which generate content on-the-fly for each visitor,
static sites are already on the server, waiting to be served.

Security is another area where static sites shine. Since static sites don’t
rely on server-side processing or databases, they are inherently less
vulnerable to security breaches. There’s no login portal for hackers to
exploit, and fewer moving parts mean fewer potential points of failure. In
contrast, platforms like WordPress require regular updates and maintenance to
patch vulnerabilities, which can be time-consuming and technically challenging
for those who aren’t familiar with managing servers or databases. There's just
more headaches. You got a whole technology to learn, unlike static websites,
which are just plain files on your filesystem.

Efficiency is another key advantage of static site generators. Platforms like
WordPress often require expensive hosting solutions with high resource limits.
With a static site, you don’t need powerful servers because the heavy lifting
is done during the initial build phase.

Simplicity is another one. Gone are the days of dealing with complicated
plugins, themes, and updates that are common with CMS platforms like WordPress.
With Hugo, you don’t have to worry about PHP installations, MySQL databases, or
server configurations. Instead, you focus on writing content and structuring
your site in a way that feels natural to you. As said, it's just files on your
filesystem.

Finally, static sites are often more
[SEO-friendly](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/seo-starter-guide)
than their dynamic counterparts. Search engines *love* static content because
it’s easy to crawl and index. Since there’s no complex code running in the
background, your site can load faster and deliver a better user experience,
both of which are important factors in search engine rankings. Additionally,
many Hugo themes come with built-in SEO optimisations which search engines
prefer.

### How do you have a search bar?

As you probably noticed, this website has a search function. Given this
information, you might be inclined to think that this website is dynamic. What
if I told you that this is not the case. *"How is this possible?"* you may ask.

On a static website, such as this one, the search function works differently
from how it does on a dynamic website like WordPress. Since there's no server
involved to process your search query in real-time, the search is handled
entirely by JavaScript running in your web browser.

When you load this website, the JavaScript code along with the content and
metadata of other pages is already embedded into the webpage. This means that
the search functionality doesn't need to send your request to a server;
instead, it simply looks through the data stored in the JavaScript files on
your local browser. When you type a keyword into the search bar, the JavaScript
listens for your input and quickly scans through the stored content and
metadata to find matching results. These results are then displayed on your
screen without needing any server processing whatsoever. Lastly, this is all
handled by the theme that this website implements; no manual work goes into
this.

Using such creative solutions, it is possible to have features on a static
website that are ordinarily found on dynamic websites. All this to say: static
websites are far better than dynamic ones.

## Nature of this guide

In this guide, we will not be going through every single aspect of Hugo, since
there's plenty of resources available on this subject. Hugo documentation
itself is beginner-friendly enough to be understandable to those who are new to
the concept. Instead, we will go through some high-level basics for those who
have never used a static web generator before, or even hosted a website before.
That way, we can provide an adequate starting point to branch out from --
hopefully.

## Introduction to Hugo

![Logo of the Hugo software project](/creating_a_website/hugo-logo.svg)

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is one of the most popular [free
software](/docs/licensing_for_beginners/#free-software) static site generators
available today. It's written in Go (a programming language known for its
efficiency) and is very simple to use. Here are some key features:

- **Works on all platforms**: Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Plenty of themes**: Hugo has a large ecosystem. As such,
there's [many themes to choose from](https://themes.gohugo.io/).
- **Template-based design**: Uses templates to define
how your content will look. This makes it easy to customise themes, if you want
to modify one you found, or to make one from scratch.
- **Write in Markdown**: Allows you to write
content in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/), a
lightweight markup language that’s easy to learn and use. No need for laggy
WYSIWYG WordPress editors or other wheel reinventions. Looks something like the
following:
```md
# This is a title
Some text, and a list of things
- List item 1
- List item 2
## A header
With some `code text`
```

{{< notice note >}}
Hugo is a command-line interface (CLI) program, which means that you need to
interface with it using the terminal. On Windows, you will have to use
PowerShell, which is not the same as Windows PowerShell. Command Prompt will
not work.

## Setting up Hugo

Hugo is a program, so we need to install it. It can be installed in different
ways depending on your operating system.

---

#### For Windows users:

Download the Hugo MSI installer from the [official Hugo releases
page](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) and follow the installation
instructions. Alternative ways of installing it may be found
[here](https://gohugo.io/installation/windows/).

#### For macOS users with Homebrew installed:

```fish
brew install hugo
```

#### For Ubuntu/Debian users:

```fish
sudo apt update && sudo apt install hugo
```

{{< notice warning >}}
Hugo in the Debian respository is very outdated. It is recommended to
manually install the binary from [Hugo's GitHub
repository](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) instead.
{{< /notice >}}

#### For Fedora users:

```fish
sudo dnf install hugo
```

{{< notice info >}}
Hugo in the Fedora respository is slightly outdated. Some themes might depend
on latest version of Hugo to work fully.
{{< /notice >}}

---

Once you have installed Hugo on your system, you can verify that it is
installed by running `hugo version` in your terminal, which should give output
like the following:

```txt
hugo v0.143.1 linux/amd64 BuildDate=2025-02-04 VendorInfo=gohugoio
```

### Fundamentals of Hugo

Hugo is one of those brilliantly simple solutions, that is so simple it might be
difficult to understand, if one is familiar with all kinds of unnecessary and
complex solutions.

When you create a website using Hugo, you're essentially telling it to take
your raw content -- text files written in Markdown -- and combine them with
templates, which define how your site looks, to build a complete,
ready-to-publish website. Unlike platforms like WordPress, where every page is
generated dynamically when someone visits your site, Hugo does all the work
upfront when you run `hugo build`.

By compiling your site once and serving those static files, Hugo simplifies web
development while offering the flexibility to create sophisticated websites.
The workflow is always something like the following:

### Edit content

Set up your posts, articles, documentation, or whatever in the `content`
directory of your project, using your favourite text editor.

### Compile website

Run `hugo build`, or just `hugo`, in your project. This process takes about 250
ms.

### Deploy website

Deploy files from the `public` directory, where your complete website is
contained, to your hosting service.

[Further details on the basics of
Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/usage/).

## Understanding the directory structure

Hugo projects -- sometimes varying very slightly with the theme -- follow a
specific folder structure that organises content, assets, and configurations
logically.


- `config.yaml`: Configuration file for Hugo, which dictates project-wide
functionality and behaviour. Hugo supports YAML, TOML, and JSON formats
equally, though the general preference is for YAML.
- `content`: Where all your website's content (posts, pages, etc.) reside.
Inside are the files you actually edit to modify the content of your website.
- `themes`: Contains the theme directories you choose to use.
- `assets`: Holds static files that override static theme files, like CSS
stylesheets.
- `layouts`: Custom template files if needed, which can override theme layouts
also. If you have a file here called `header.html`, and if the theme implements
one, then your `header.html` template will override the theme one.
- `static`: Static files for your content. If you have a file here called
`image.webp`, you access it in content by calling `/image.webp`.
- `public`: The default directory where Hugo builds your site for production,
but it can be changed with the `--destination` option. These files are not
meant to be edited; they are the complete website.

Understanding this structure is necessary in order for the website to compile
properly, as Hugo depends on files to be in specific directories and
subdirectories. More information on this can be found in [the Hugo
documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/directory-structure/).

## Creating your first website

Let's walk through creating a basic Hugo website, step-by-step.

### Initialise a new Hugo project

Open your terminal/PowerShell and navigate to where you want to create your site. Run:
```fish
hugo new site my-site
cd my-site
```

### Add content

Create your first page or post by running:
```fish
hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
```
This creates a Markdown file in the content directory. Open it in a text editor and add your content:

```md
+++
title = "My First Post"
date = 2023-10-01
+++
Hello, World! This is my first Hugo post.
```

The lines surrounded by `+++` signs are known in Hugo as [front
matter](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/). They contain
metadata, define how a specific page should behave, and other things that might
be relevant on a page-by-page basis.

### Select and install a theme

Most themes are hosted on GitHub, but you can find most of them [here on Hugo's
website](https://themes.gohugo.io/). Once you find one you like, use the links
on the website to navigate to the theme's repository and download it. You can
either clone the repository using Git or [download the ZIP file
directly](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/downloading-files-from-github).

Download and place a theme in your `themes` directory. For example:

```fish
mkdir -p themes/hugo-theme-bootstrap
cp -R /path/to/theme/files/* themes/hugo-theme-bootstrap/
```

Update `config.yaml`:

```yaml
theme: "hugo-theme-bootstrap"
```

A lot of themes offer additional configuration options, such as colors or
layout settings. Refer to the theme's documentation for any specific
requirements.

### Build and serve the site

In your terminal, run:

```fish
hugo server
```

This starts a local web server. Visit
[http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313) to see your site. Or, if you
used `--bind=0.0.0.0`, you can access it from other devices on your network.
The site will recompile and show changes whenever you make changes to the
files. This makes iterating upon the website very quick and easy.

### Customise your site

Modify the configuration files, add your own CSS/JS, or create additional content as needed.

The `config.yaml` (or `.toml`) file is where you set global preferences for your site:

---

#### YAML

```yaml
title: "My Hugo Website"
description: "A beautiful static website built with Hugo."
author: "John Doe"
baseURL: "https://mywebsite.com/"
languageCode: "en-us"
timezone: "UTC"
```

#### TOML

```toml
title = "My Hugo Website"
description = "A beautiful static website built with Hugo."
author = "John Doe"
baseURL = "https://mywebsite.com/"
languageCode = "en-us"
timezone = "UTC"
```

---

You can also configure settings like
[Disqus](https://gohugo.io/content-management/comments/), social media links,
etc., depending on the theme's capabilities. More on project configuration
[here](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/).

Unless you are very unfamiliar with the CLI, in which case you may not be able
to fully comprehend the above steps, you should have a fully functional website
after following these steps. 


[Hugo's
documentation](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/) has
a page on how to host on GitHub Pages. It is entirely free of charge, but you
might also consider [hosting fully
independently](/docs/landchad/get_a_website/) like a landchad.

## Working with templates

What we covered is just the tip of the iceberg. Should you want to modify an
existing theme, or even make a new one from scratch: Hugo uses Go templating
language to help automate compiling content. You can modify templates in the
theme directory or create custom layouts in your project's `layouts` folder.

For example, to add a custom header:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>{{ .title }}</title>
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="{{ .Site baseURL }}">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="{{ .Site baseURL }}/about">About</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>
  {{ .Content }}
</body>
</html>
```

More on this in [Hugo's
documentation](https://gohugo.io/templates/introduction/).

### Adding Custom CSS/JavaScript

You can add custom styles and scripts by placing them in your theme's `assets`
directory or within your project's `assets` folder. For example:

- Place your `custom.css` in `themes/your-theme/assets/css/`.
- Include it in your layout template:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ .themePath }}assets/css/custom.css">
```
- Similarly, for JavaScript files:
```html
<script src="{{ .themePath }}assets/js/custom.js"></script>
```
