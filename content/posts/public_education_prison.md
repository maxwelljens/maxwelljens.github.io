As always, before we get to meat of the matter, let's first establish the
terms. What is public school? In Europe, one most often does not think about
school in terms of whether it is public or private, at least at the primary
level. In Europe especially, public school is considered such an integral part
of life that simply saying 'school' in the context of primary education is
immediately understood. In places like Norway, private primary education is not
even legal. This also means that public school is seldom examined critically.

But why is it important whether or not school is public or private? Why is that
a necessary distinction? The distinction is in history, so let's dive into it.

Public education did not become a serious proposition until the latter half of
19th century. That century was the beginning of the Industrial Revolution,
which we feel the effects of to this day. The world hegemon at that time was
the British Empire, sometimes also known as the empire upon which the sun never
sets. If it was night in the British Isles, it was day in Singapore and Hong
Kong. If it was night in New Zealand and Australia, it was day in British
Caribbean. It was an enormous network of territories spanning a quarter of the
globe.

{{< figure src="/public_education_prison/british_empire.png" attr="British Empire at its greatest extent in 1901." link="/public_education_prison/british_empire.png" target="_blank" >}}

This raises an obvious question: how could the British Empire possibly maintain
such an empire without the Internet or airplanes? The electrical telegraph did
start rolling around by 1850, but it is of little help if your population is
comprised largely of illiterates; small pool to draw bureaucrats from.
[According to Henry E. Cowper's 1979 Ph.D.
thesis](https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/18114), the answer is that they
didn't. The Italian Empire formed in 1869, the German Empire formed in 1871,
and soon enough other countries started picking up this new hot thing called
industrialisation. This meant fierce competition. The British Empire could no
longer play it slow. In fact, they had some of the least educated citizenry in
Europe. They had to pick up speed, but all of their strength laid in their
dominions, which were all spread out throughout the globe. You could not
control all of that with a few bureaucrats in Westminster. Rather, you needed
bureaucrats in all the dominions, who are capable of independent calculation,
assessment based on scholarly knowledge, and innate understanding of the
protocols of trade and customs.

State-funded education, then, was the solution. The goal was not to foster
creativity, critical thinking, or individual genius. It was to solve a massive
human resources problem. The British Empire required a standardised,
interchangeable class of administrators, clerks, and officers who could be
relied upon to execute orders, maintain ledgers, and uphold the system without
question, whether in London, Calcutta, or Hong Kong. It needed to mass-produce
cogs for its vast imperial machine. The educational system that arose from this
need was, therefore, designed with industrial efficiency in mind. Its primary
aim was not the enlightenment of the individual, but the production of
compliant and functional human components to serve the needs of the state and
its sprawling commercial enterprises.

To achieve this industrial-scale production of bureaucrats, the system’s
architects required a blueprint for mass conditioning. They found a perfect one
in the most efficient and celebrated institution of their age: the factory. The
internal logic of the public school is not the logic of the ancient Lyceum or
the Renaissance studio; it is the logic of the assembly line. The ringing of
bells to signal the start of a lesson, a break, or the end of the day was not
an academic innovation. It was a factory innovation, designed to discipline a
workforce and habituate them to the tyranny of the clock. Students were not
grouped by intellectual curiosity or aptitude, but batched by their
'manufacture date', which was their age, and moved through a standardised
process, from one subject station to the next, for a predetermined amount of
time. The curriculum itself became a set of specifications for a uniform
product: a citizen with a baseline of literacy and numeracy, ready to be
slotted into a role. It was the perfect solution to maintain British supremacy
over the continental wannabes.

This factory model, designed for efficiency, necessarily created an environment
of coercion and rigidity. The physical layout of the classroom was optimised
for surveillance and top-down instruction: rows of silent workers (students)
facing a single foreman (the teacher). This was not the environment for
exploration or discovery. The highest virtues were those of the factory floor
or the military barracks: punctuality, obedience, and the silent completion of
repetitive tasks. Critical thought, creativity, and dissent were not just
unrewarded, they were liabilities to the operation. Which one? Of the grand
empire. Not yours, stupid.

Of course, as with many things, this development was not exclusively negative.
Rarely is this the case. Even the atomic bomb paved way for the best method of
generating energy there is.

Indeed, the alternative to this new citizen factory was often the very real
anguish of low-wage plebeian labour. Brutal labour. While Britain was
engineering a system to produce compliant clerks, nations like Norway, contrary
to any romantic notion of rustic Scandinavian life, [actually made use of child
labour to a greater extent than Sweden, Britain, or the United
States](https://www.ssb.no/arbeid-og-lonn/sysselsetting/artikler/barnearbeid-i-industrien-1870-1915).
Before the state saw children as future bureaucrats, factory owners saw them as
cheap labour, and nowhere was this more apparent than in the tobacco and
matchstick industries. According to Statistics Norway research, a staggering 42
percent of the workforce in tobacco factories were children; in matchstick
production, it was 35 percent. They were sent into these facilities to be
exposed to toxins so potent they caused a condition known as ['phossy
jaw,'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phossy_jaw) where the white phosphorus
would literally rot the bone from their faces.

![](/public_education_prison/child_labourer.jpg)

Faced with a generation being physically disintegrated by industry, the state’s
intervention with compulsory education looks less like an act of enlightenment
and more like a pragmatic reclamation of a valuable resource. The research of
Jakob Neumann Mohn, who chronicled this horror and would build the cornerstone
of Statistics Norway, became the state's blueprint. The explicit goal, in his
own words, was *"at beskytte Manden i Barnet"*, or to protect the Man in the
Child. Whether or not this was a sentimental plea is up for debate, but Mohn's
calculus was clear: a child maimed in a factory is a net loss to the state,
incapable of becoming a productive worker or a competent soldier. He argued
that child labour suppressed adult wages by creating a class of desperate
competitors, and that it destroyed the workforce before it could even mature.
The establishment of public schooling, therefore, was a strategic pivot. The
state wrested control of children from the factory owners, pulling them from
the chaotic brutality of the assembly line and placing them onto the
structured, disciplined production line of the public school. It was a choice
between two factories, but one of them didn't actively dissolve your bones.

Now to the present. One would expect a lot to have changed over the course of
120-150 years. Usually, these sorts of developments undergo truly radical
transformation over such long spans of time. The early Mercedes-Benz that
Hitler rode is nothing like the latest 2025 C-Class. The electrical telegraph
is now the Internet, a technology eclipsing its origins to such an extent that
the remaining continuity is purely conceptual.

As we all know, however, the public school remains almost entirely unchanged
from the early 20th century. The same organisation of classrooms remains. The
bell still rings to signal the start and stop of playtime. With time, some
countries even banned private alternatives to public primary education, as
mentioned earlier.

In fact, I am going to argue that public schools have become worse in some
significant ways since the times of Industrial Revolution. The chief of which
is the formation of unisex schools. Contrary to what a fringe minority of
deranged people would like us to believe, there are profound and inseparable
differences between boys and girls. For instance, boys better learn visually,
whereas girls through relationships. This is why comic books are popular with
boys, whereas novels are popular with girls.

Girls mature at a faster rate than boys, and kind of just grow up to be women
automatically, whereas a man is needed to turn a boy into another man. This is
an especially pressing concern that, as far as I know, has never been addressed
at any school in the west. I am sure there are lucky classrooms that have
masculine teachers who are strong in character to guide both the boys and the
girls towards not just educational success, but personal success. In my case, I
have had nothing but melancholic teachers who clearly struggled with finding
any joy in their work, perhaps even their lives as a whole. Most of them were
women as well, clearly woefully untrained to deal with (often unique) problems
that arise in boyhood.

What, then, is the practical result of this one-size-fits-all model, this
deliberate ignorance of fundamental biology? The system, by default, ends up
optimised for one sex at the expense of the other. The modern classroom prizes
quiet compliance, orderly group discussion, and emotional introspection -- a
matrix of behaviours that aligns far more naturally with the developmental
trajectory of girls. A boy’s innate drive for kinetics, competition, and
tangible problem-solving is not seen as a different learning style, but as a
behavioural problem. He is not channelled; he is pathologised. His inability to
sit still for six hours is suddenly not a failure of the environment, but a
defect in his brain chemistry, for which there is, conveniently, [a medical
diagnosis and a
pill](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/adhd-symptoms-boys-vs-girls). The
factory has simply been retooled to produce a different kind of compliant
citizen, one neutered of the very masculine energy that built the empires in
the first place.

And who oversees this retooling? [This system is overwhelmingly administered by
women](https://www.utdanningsnytt.no/hovedsak-thom-jambak-yrkesfag/skjev-kjonnsfordeling-blant-laererne-kan-bidra-til-a-opprettholde-forskjellene-mellom-gutters-og-jenters-valg/313081#:~:text=Omtrent%2090%20prosent%20av%20barnehagel%C3%A6rerne,rundt%2070%20prosent%20kvinnelige%20l%C3%A6rere.).
This is not a failure of individual female teachers, many of whom are
undoubtedly dedicated and competent, but a catastrophic failure of
institutional design. A boy, who requires the firm example of a man to navigate
the path to manhood, is instead left in a world of almost exclusively feminine
authority during his most formative years. The few men who remain are often not
the strong role models needed. They are the ones who haven't quit [despite
truly lousy wages when compared to all other
professions](https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/01/27/teacher-salaries-in-europe-where-are-the-highest-rises-and-falls-in-real-terms).
From the boy's perspective, school ceases to be a place of education and
becomes an engine of weird social engineering, setting you on a path that you
don't understand. I didn't understand why I had to read novels either, until
only a few years ago. Turns out, I had to do it because it was never meant for
me, it was for the girls.

Of course, there are a few scholarly domains where sitting down and boring
yourself with the details is the only way of learning an important topic. There
are only a limited amount of ways of teaching mathematics in a way that imparts
the needed mathematical skill.

Mathematics, chemistry, physics: these domains demand a foundation of
brute-force memorization and abstract logic. Few dispute this, but this is only
a fraction of what a well-rounded school entails. What of history, of religion,
of the arts? These are the realms of human drama, of epic struggle, of heroism
and betrayal. Yet how are they presented? The thunder of legions and the
ambition of emperors are reduced to a dry analysis of socioeconomic factors, or
poetry nobody cares about. The great epics that were meant to forge a boy's
character are not even shown in class. Instead, we got tedious explorations of
patriarchal power structures, or emotional inspection of a woman's view on
feminism, or something like that. These are all examples from my cloudy memory,
mind you. Cloudy not because my memory from childhood is poor, but because
these literary works really, really sucked.

This is where the model collapses into true psychological cruelty. When a boy
is force-fed a curriculum that is not merely uninteresting but actively hostile
to his masculine inclinations, he does exactly what a prisoner does: he rebels.
Yes, we are finally getting to the title. He becomes disruptive, he disengages,
he seeks distraction. And the system, in its profound lack of self-awareness,
blames him for its own failure. The factory has thus perfected its design. It
is no longer just a physical prison of bells and schedules; it has become a
psychic prison, an environment engineered to alienate a boy from his own nature
and convince him it is a pathology. The walls are no longer just brick and
mortar; they are built from a curriculum that denies him heroes and a social
structure that denies him masculine role models.

The dynamics of a prison and of the modern public school are eerily similar,
but I will do you one better: prison has more positives over the public school.
Let's draw some parallels.

In a public school, you are there because you have to be there. Well,
technically in places like Norway and most other countries, there is a duty to
educate, not duty to send to school. However, given that most Norwegian parents
do not have the personal resources for homeschooling, and private alternatives
are banned, pretty much everyone gets sent to public school. With how
fragmented, individualistic, and hyper-liberal modern western societies have
become, you have kids in one place who come from radically divergent
backgrounds, to the point where there is nothing fundamentally binding them
together. Mass migration has made even ethnic basis a challenge. Decline in
church life weakened family and community units. Basically, the entire place
becomes a borderline mental asylum of idiosyncrasies, that the teachers often
have few resources to handle, simply don't care to handle, or maybe are even
disallowed from intervening at all. God help you if your mother tongue is not
Norwegian.

Meanwhile, in a prison, you actually have a lot in common with the other
prisoners right out of the gate: you have sinned. Depending on the severity of
your crime, there are no pretenses that someone is below you or above you, that
their family is different from yours, or that your mother tongue is not native.
Of course, there is a large difference between most European prisons and what's
essentially [a mass isolation chamber of El Salvador where most MS-13 gang
members are destined to sit out the rest of their lives in complete
silence, while being fed
slop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_Confinement_Center). In this
essay, I am chiefly talking about Norwegian prison.

This fundamental difference in social cohesion leads to a second, more profound
distinction: the presence of a clear, albeit brutal, code of conduct. The
social landscape of a school is a jungle of unwritten rules, shifting
alliances, and psychological warfare. Cliques form and dissolve, bullying is
rampant but often subtle, and a student’s status can be destroyed by a rumour.
It is a world of constant, low-grade anxiety governed by the whims of the
immature. I speak from experience. A prison, by contrast, operates on a rigid
and explicit hierarchy. The rules are harsh, and the consequences for breaking
them are immediate and violent, but they are known. There is a brutal honesty
to this system. Your place is understood, and navigating the environment, while
dangerous, is a matter of understanding a clear (though unwritten) code. It is
a world that demands situational awareness and respect for power; a harsh but
straightforward lesson that is arguably more useful than navigating the chaotic
emotional minefield of the schoolyard.

Furthermore, let's consider the stated purpose versus the practical outcome. A
school's purpose is 'education,' an abstract goal that for many boys translates
into years of forced compliance with subjects they find meaningless. They leave
with a diploma, perhaps, but few tangible skills that lead to self-sufficiency.
A modern Norwegian prison, however, has a concrete and tangible purpose:
rehabilitation. An inmate is often given the opportunity to learn a trade; to
become a carpenter, a welder, or a mechanic. They can acquire practical,
marketable skills in an environment that understands the value of tangible
work. The school takes a boy, forces him to sit still, and lectures him on
poetry. The prison takes a man, acknowledges his sins, but also need for
purpose, and hands him a tool. One system prepares you for a life of abstract
thought and bureaucratic compliance; the other can prepare you to actually
build something, maybe even your own character. Absolutely nothing builds
character like true repentance.

That is why, when someone told me that he knows several ex-convicts who
preferred prison over school, I did not require further elaboration. I
understood immediately why they said that. Now, when someone asks what the
point of public schools is, if you can be taught most of the essentials at
home, the usual answer I heard is, "For the social aspect." Maybe people who
respond this way have had a good time. I am not in a position to deny someone
else's anecdotal experience with my own testimony, but here are the things I
was taught from social interaction at school:

- That you cannot trust anyone. Friendships are spontaneous, fleeting, subject
to unsigned contract agreements.
- To hate other people. I have screamed at many students in bouts of unfiltered
rage.
- Not to open yourself up too much to other people.
- [That I am the problem, everyone else is
correct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Jante). I was actually once
berated by a teacher in high school for finding issue with music being played
by a student in the middle of an ongoing lesson.
- To become addicted to pornography. If I was to be constantly anxious and on
the verge of mental collapse, the natural outlet was pornography, readily
accessible through the Internet.

![](/public_education_prison/head_vi.jpg)

In my mind, this is the actual social curriculum. It is a fifteen-year
masterclass in navigating a world without honour, a practicum in mistrust, and
a seminar on the management of your own simmering resentment. When confronted
with this reality, the assertion that ex-convicts might prefer the brutal
honesty of a prison yard to the psychological warfare of the schoolyard ceases
to be shocking. It becomes perfectly logical. A prison acknowledges the
prisoner is broken and, in its best modern form, offers a some kind of path to
rebuilding through repentance. The public school, in its current form, takes a
healthy boy, convinces him that his own nature is a pathology, and offers him
only compliance as a cure. One system breaks your body but can offer to rebuild
your character; the other slowly grinds your character down and has the
audacity to call it education.

Nearly every single insecurity that I have as a person is in some way tied to
or originates from my years at public school. It was not until I was baptised
at the Eastern Orthodox Church that I really started to understand the depth of
my wounds (and evil). All of what I learned about socialisation had to be
undone through over a decade of self-discovery, self-reflection, bitterness,
anger, and confusion, before I really got an appreciation for the depth of the
damage I received from school. I have mostly healed from all this damage, but I
can still feel the subconscious fear when I walk by someone on the street if
they stare at me for too long. If the 19th century public schooling system was
a bureaucrat factory, the 21st century public school is a trauma factory.

To be clear, I am not implying that public school is the source of all evil in
the world; that by eliminating it, we institute a utopia. In the modern world,
there is an uncountable amount of ways to wound oneself, and still many other
ways in which wounds are forced upon us. I am still quite grateful that I got
the opportunity to learn how to read, write, do math, learn about some
important history, and many other things that I still find use for in my life.

However, if there is one thing we should pray for every day, is that we do not
witness more events like [the one on 2nd April 2024 in Vantaa, Finland, where a
12-year-old stole his father's weapon, took it to school, and murdered one of
his peers](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-68712104). Clueless parents
said, "We need to control guns better!" I said, "My God, it is a miracle our
children are not terminated like this every single day." I know, because this
12-year-old could have been me.
