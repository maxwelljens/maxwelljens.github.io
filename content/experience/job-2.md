People with digital competence and creativity are in extraordinary high
demand. Many of today's jobs will disappear, and far too few job applicants
have the knowledge and skills to cover the industry´s current and future needs.
People’s skill sets need to be developed, and education is the solution.

Noroff is the premier academic institution in the Nordics for IT, both at
university and vocational level. In my time there, I have seen that there were
many capable teachers and students.

To that end, I was hired as a vocational school teacher at Noroff. Course lead
for Linux and introductory course. I created a new Linux course, as it required
modernisation and a better pedagogic experience for the students.
