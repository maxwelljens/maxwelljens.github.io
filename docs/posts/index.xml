      <description>The Internet is a mega entertainment complex built on top of a graveyard of meaning.

BBS, Usenet, MUDs and other such 1990s constructs were not part of my childhood, but I still got to explore some of the wild Internet of the early 2000s.</description>

      <description>European governments are characterised by tyranny in a degenerating western societal order. There are many wrong ways and only some correct ways in combating this degeneration without pointlessly sacrificing yourself, or, more than likely, making matters even worse for everyone.

      <description>The most fundamental, yet seriously overlooked, aspect of any software is licensing. Whether we like it or not, the fact is that anything we create or want to use is subject to copyright.
