    <p>I am a proud European, but, a lot more than that, I am also a citizen of the Republic of Poland. Watching what is happening west of us is difficult to put into words. When watching nations, that were formerly the greatest empires to have ever existed in human history – The British Empire, The German Empire, The French Empire – systematically orchestrating their own annihilation, you cannot just accept that at face value. You are forced to rationalise it. You invent comforting lies to explain why your neighbors are systematically eradicating their own kind. You have to do that, since they are your neighbours, who are nice. To readily accept and dispassionately observe their downfall would be a cruel betrayal of our good and long-lasting relationships.

    <p>On 10th September 2025, a shooter climbed onto the roof of a building at Utah State University, Utah, USA.

Charlie sat in his iconic ‘Prove Me Wrong’ tent, seated in front of a table, where he would invite university students to debate him. It was one of the many ordinary tours that Charlie was well-known for, having done them since the age of 18.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>As always, before we get to meat of the matter, let’s first establish the terms. What is public school? In Europe, one most often does not think about school in terms of whether it is public or private, at least at the primary level. In Europe especially, public school is considered such an integral part of life that simply saying ‘school’ in the context of primary education is immediately understood. In places like Norway, private primary education is not even legal. This also means that public school is seldom examined critically.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>By now, almost everyone in the industrialised world is aware of something known as ‘AI,’ or artificial intelligence for short. They might not use it, they might not have an idea of what it even is, but they are certain to be aware of the term. Among those who don’t know the particulars, they are largely indifferent. Those who are more technologically literate and curious about the technology, however, might have a strong opinion about it. People who don’t have a strong opinion about AI are just regular people. People who are convinced that AI is not just an industrial revolution, but something that will change the entire fabric society as we know it, we call the pro-AI cult. On the opposite side, we have people who say that AI will not do any of that, but rather cause the psychic, economic and creative death of the world as we know it; the anti-AI cult.

    <h2 class="entry-hint-parent">Norway vs. EU: Shooting Itself in the Foot?
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>As far back as 1972, Norway had a referendum on whether or not to join the European Union (EU). For reference, this was so far back that the EU didn’t even exist yet. It was only the Economic European Community (EEC) back then. Narrowly, the population voted about 53% nay. There was another referendum, a lot more recently, in 1994. That time, it was even more narrow, with 52% voting nay. Sweden, which had referendum at around the same time, voted 53% yay instead, and became a member of the EU. This raises a perfectly obvious question: was the Norwegian public wise in these two landmark decisions? Clearly it is not a cut-and-dry issue, as all that decided the outcome was only about 100,000 people. If 100,000 more people were convinced that EU would be to Norway’s benefit – rather than to its detriment – Norway would have been an EU member in either 1972 or 1994. Let’s examine this more closely.

    <p>My name is Maxwell Jensen. I was born and raised in Norway, but my story begins in Poland. My father was a naval officer from Gdańsk who sought asylum in Norway in 1986, and my mother immigrated from Zambrów in 1996.
The goal here is to share some insights that might be relevant to Norwegians, or really, anyone who finds multicultural exchanges interesting. We all know we live in a world of global exchange – not just of goods, but of ideas and culture. With this short essay, I hope to offer some insights and constructive criticism that everyone can use to expand their worldview. While I don’t believe that simply importing people of fundamentally incompatible cultures constitutes a valid social policy, I do believe every culture offers at least one thing that can widen our perception of the world for the better. And let me be clear, this is a two-way street: my life in Norway has had a formative, profoundly positive impact on how I view the world, which I will get into later.

    <p>Fedora is an awesome Linux distribution, but what makes it even more awesome is the fact that you can run AI on it fairly easily. That is, if you know how to run it first, which is the hard part. This article goes through some technical details of getting certain Fedora-specific problems out of the way. Since most Linux guides regarding AI cater to Debian-based or Arch-based systems, I have found very little information on how to get some AI tools running on Fedora.

    <p>Dynamic websites are websites that generate content on-the-fly, tailored to each user’s request. Unlike static websites, which serve the same page every time someone visits, dynamic sites pull data from a database or other sources to create unique pages for each visitor.
For example, when you visit a blog powered by WordPress, the site dynamically pulls the latest posts, comments, and user information from its database to display a personalised experience. This ability to change content in real-time is why dynamic websites are used for e-commerce sites, social media platforms, and other websites where user interaction and fresh content are essential.

    <p>The most fundamental, yet seriously overlooked aspect of any software is licensing. Whether we like it or not, the fact is that anything we create or want to use is subject to copyright. Worst of all, legal illiteracy is a major issue in the free software sphere.
The amount of developers who do not understand licensing is staggering, and it has serious consequences; a lot of corporate exploitation. Developers after developers keep getting tricked.
