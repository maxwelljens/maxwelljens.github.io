  "articleBody": "On 10th September 2025, a shooter climbed onto the roof of a building at Utah State University, Utah, USA. He was positioned approximately 200 metres away from Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA (TPUSA). Charlie sat in his iconic ‘Prove Me Wrong’ tent, seated in front of a table, where he would invite university students to debate him. It was one of the many ordinary tours that Charlie was well-known for, having done them since the age of 18.\nIn the debate that was ongoing, a student asked Kirk a question about transexual school shooters. ‘Do you know how many mass shooters there have been in America over the last 10 years?’ Kirk replied with a question. ‘Counting or not counting gang violence?’ The student did not have time to provide clarification. At the age of 31, Charlie’s life was extinguished as the assassin discharged his weapon, striking Charlie in the neck, opening his jugular vein. Having had the misfortune of reviewing footage of the moment of the strike, I was almost immediately aware that his death would follow moments later. I was also deeply disturbed. His wife Erika had become a widow and his two children became fatherless. His last word on this planet was ‘violence’, and violence there was.\nArizonans mourn Turning Point USA Founder Charlie Kirk outside the Turning Point USA headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona.\nFor whatever reason, despite never having known or cared that much about Charlie’s work, I felt as though the world had become a suddenly much worse place. Much worse than it already is, that is. It was later that I learned from people all over the world – including patristic voices in Eastern Orthodox Church that I am part of – that Charlie’s entire career had been not just about pushing for MAGA and other political topics particular to the USA, but also a powerful voice in the global Christian world. Granted that he was an Evangelical, a branch of Protestantism, so not in my church, but our doctrine has never been to pretend heretics don’t exist or that they don’t deserve love. Everyone deserves love, including non-Christians. Not empathy, which is a word often abused by the godless to mean a fake form of love that is conditional in nature; selfish; not love. Charlie displayed love.\nMore importantly, Charlie Kirk was brave. Braver than I could ever possibly have been. Simply the prospect of going to a super-leftist university campus is enough to instil anxiety in me. Setting up a table to debate people who disagree with you on every topic, who find your belief in Christ contemptible? Not for me, I would never do it. But Charlie Kirk did that. He went there, because if he did not have belief in Christ, he had belief in one thing: reaching out those who disagree with you with a calm voice, respect, and utmost love. This is a common ground that even most hardline atheists can stand on. His entire career was built on this principle. That is what TPUSA is. He was not an undeserving lobbyist, a run-off-the-mill politician, or an extremist demagogue. Whatever money he earned, he earned it through a platform of being respectful and preaching moderate views. Whether he sincerely held these views is irrelevant. I did not care much for his political views either, they were fairly milquetoast.\nBut his love for youth was unmatched. Where most people saw aspiring future workers or scientists, Charlie saw warriors for Christ who could become a lot more. Warriors whose sword and shield are the good news and the Lord, with the ability to not just reshape the world, but secure their own salvation. Nobody tended to the youth in the US the way Charlie did. He was the last remaining vestige of anything approximating sanity on atheistic and mostly radical leftist university campuses.\nI would go so far as to say, Charlie Kirk was probably the only person in the 21st century to truly embody the concept of freedom and democracy as it is taught to us at public school. The only person to go to people, who often hated him on a personal level, who vilified him, yet never once even raise his voice, resort to violence, or belittling those he viewed as opponents. As far as the cameras – which have been rolling for 13 years – are concerned, Charlie Kirk showed Christlike respect upon all atheists and leftists. While the careers of people who sit in front of tables are often part of a mostly uninteresting office job or questionable political mongering, Charlie’s table was possibly the most profound table in all of the western world. It was a table of democracy; of debate.\nOne would think, then, that such a milquetoast, kind – if maybe a bit strange – American conservative would have been assassinated, that his death would not leave any room for interpretation of whether or not he deserved getting slain like cattle, destined to bleed out and traumatise millions of people worldwide.\nI was proven wrong immediately. Demonic cackles and many voices of individuals possessed by Satan started howling throughout nearly every conceivable media channel in the world. Like the bells of a church, they celebrate his death, calling it a well-deserved fate, and that everyone who prays for him or his family is a right-wing weirdo and a loser. Closer to home in Europe, Amrit Kaur, the leader of Red Party Youth Norway, sarcastically voiced how terrible it is that Charlie has been murdered. Social media, such as Reddit, is brimming with memes such as ‘debate lost’ or ‘he should not have had such a big head in PVP zone.’\nIt is important that we need to hate the sin, but not the sinner. These individuals are possessed by Satan, meaning that they are not in control of their actions. They are all humans, made in the image of God. Do not let resentment or bitterness over their actions develop in you.\nNevertheless, the USA is entering a period that bears a disturbing resemblance to 1920s and early 1930s Germany – better known as the Weimar Republic. The parallels are not in policy, but in spirit. The Weimar years were defined by a crippling economic depression and a deep sense of national humiliation that created a fertile ground for extremism. A weak and distrusted democratic government found itself caught between two armies of true believers: the communists who aimed to tear it all down for a workers’ revolution, and the rising nationalist right who sought to purge the nation and restore a mythical past. In this fractured landscape, political solutions became impossible, and the stage was set for war.\nWhen debate dies, the street becomes the arbiter. The political violence of the Weimar Republic was not abstract; it was disturbing and brutal. It was a war of clubs against knives. Communists, organised in their own paramilitary wings, would descend upon the fascists and club them to death. The Brownshirts, in turn, would retaliate with daggers and assassinate communist leaders in the streets. The conflict was so ritualised that it inscribed itself onto the very bodies of the combatants. It was said that in the city hospitals, you could tell a man’s ideology by his injuries. If he was covered in bruises from blunt force trauma, he was a fascist. If he was bleeding from stab wounds, he was a communist. Sometimes the job would be finished in the hospitals, too.\nThe most terrifying sign of a collapsing society is not the violence itself, but the disappearance of neutral ground. The war in Weimar Germany did not respect the walls of a hospital. Political enemies would hunt each other down in the wards, finishing off the wounded men they had failed to kill on the pavement. A place of healing became just another battleground. This was the final stage of the collapse, where the institutions meant to uphold civilisation – medicine, law, order – became extensions of the political fight. Any semblance of a shared society had vanished. There was only the tribe and the weapon.\nIf, then, Charlie Kirk – a man whose entire career was built on non-violence and dialogue – is executed for his speech, what hope remains for the USA? His assassination is a terrifying answer to the question of what happens when debate is no longer possible. While we in Europe watch from across the Atlantic, we must ask if this is a purely American sickness or a contagion that will spread. We should hope for the best, of course, but this is not a good sign. When a society is already straining under the kind of economic misery currently gripping the US American people, the first political murder is never the last.\nAn assassination of a political figure in a fractured nation is never just a murder; it is a signal. It can be a catalyst. We saw this in 1994, when the assassination of the Hutu President of Rwanda, Juvénal Habyarimana, was used as the trigger for the systematic genocide of the Tutsi minority. That gave the killers permission to begin the slaughter. While the context is different, the principle is the same. Charlie’s murder sends a clear message to the most radical elements of the left: political violence is now on the table. The Rubicon has been crossed… or maybe it hasn’t. This uncertainty is specifically why Charlie’s assassination disturbs not just the Christian world, but reasonable non-Christians alike.\nUnfortunately, a strong indicator for why this may be a sign of very bad times to come is the fact that the celebration of Charlie’s death is not something that appeared overnight. That is, the people celebrating did not wake up on 9th or 10th September and thought to themselves, ‘Man, these right-wing nutjobs really are subhuman. I really hate them. I hope they will be tortured and killed.’ These people, who seemed ordinary, coming from all walks of life – bureaucrats, medical workers, McDonald’s staff – had these opinions for years, or decades. It is only just now that their presence is on full display, and it is horrifying.\nNevertheless, the reign of a tyrant ends when he dies. When a martyr dies, Christ’s presence only magnifies, which is why this incident is bringing out the demons. This is why his death, while a crushing tragedy for his family, is also a severe mercy for the rest of us. It is a divine clarification. In the coming Age of Weimarica, the satanic temptation will be to fight the war on the world’s terms – with the club and the knife, with hatred and bitterness. Charlie’s martyrdom is a call to reject this temptation. It is a call to boldness, a command to abandon the lukewarm faith that is so easily surrendered when the pressure of worldly affairs mounts.\nIcon of The Resurrection of Lord Jesus Christ. Not even death has dominion over Him.\nDo not cry for Charlie Kirk. He has won his crown. Weep instead for a world that murders its peacemakers. Then, pick up the weapon he wielded: a love so radical it is willing to speak truth to those who hate you, knowing it may cost you your life. We were not called to live in fear or to win political battles, but to be a faithful witness to Christ’s Resurrection unto death, and unto the ages of ages. In an age of terror, that is the only path to eternal life, and the only victory that matters.\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>On 10th September 2025, a shooter climbed onto the roof of a building at Utah
State University, Utah, USA. He was positioned approximately 200 metres away
from Charlie Kirk, the founder of <em>Turning Point USA</em> (TPUSA). Charlie sat in
his iconic &lsquo;Prove Me Wrong&rsquo; tent, seated in front of a table, where he would
invite university students to debate him. It was one of the many ordinary tours
that Charlie was well-known for, having done them since the age of 18.</p>
<p>In the debate that was ongoing, a student asked Kirk a question about
transexual school shooters. &lsquo;<em>Do you know how many mass shooters there have
been in America over the last 10 years?</em>&rsquo; Kirk replied with a question.
&lsquo;<em>Counting or not counting gang violence?</em>&rsquo; The student did not have time to
provide clarification. At the age of 31, Charlie&rsquo;s life was extinguished as the
assassin discharged his weapon, striking Charlie in the neck, opening his
jugular vein. Having had the misfortune of reviewing footage of the moment of
the strike, I was almost immediately aware that his death would follow moments

two children became fatherless. His last word on this planet was &lsquo;violence&rsquo;,
and violence there was.</p>

<p>For whatever reason, despite never having known or cared that much about
Charlie&rsquo;s work, I felt as though the world had become a suddenly much worse
place. Much worse than it already is, that is. It was later that I learned from
people all over the world &ndash; including patristic voices in Eastern Orthodox
Church that I am part of &ndash; that Charlie&rsquo;s entire career had been not just
about pushing for <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/MAGA-movement">MAGA</a> and

global Christian world. Granted that he was an Evangelical, a branch of
Protestantism, so not in my church, but our doctrine has never been to pretend
heretics don&rsquo;t exist or that they don&rsquo;t deserve love. Everyone deserves love,
including non-Christians. Not empathy, which is a word often abused by the
godless to mean a fake form of love that is conditional in nature; selfish; not
love. Charlie displayed love.</p>
<p>More importantly, Charlie Kirk was brave. Braver than I could ever possibly
have been. Simply the prospect of going to a super-leftist university campus is
enough to instil anxiety in me. Setting up a table to debate people who
disagree with you on every topic, who find your belief in Christ contemptible?
Not for me, I would never do it. But Charlie Kirk did that. He went there,
because if he did not have belief in Christ, he had belief in one thing:
reaching out those who disagree with you with a calm voice, respect, and utmost
love. This is a common ground that even most hardline atheists can stand on.
His entire career was built on this principle. That is what TPUSA is. He was
not an undeserving lobbyist, a run-off-the-mill politician, or an extremist
demagogue. Whatever money he earned, he earned it through a platform of being
respectful and preaching moderate views. Whether he sincerely held these views
is irrelevant. I did not care much for his political views either, they were

<p>But his love for youth was unmatched. Where most people saw aspiring future
workers or scientists, Charlie saw warriors for Christ who could become a lot

ability to not just reshape the world, but secure their own salvation. Nobody

taught to us at <a href="/posts/public_education_prison/">public school</a>. The only
person to go to people, who often hated him on a personal level, who vilified
him, yet never once even raise his voice, resort to violence, or belittling
those he viewed as opponents. As far as the cameras &ndash; which have been rolling
for 13 years &ndash; are concerned, Charlie Kirk showed Christlike respect upon all
atheists and leftists. While the careers of people who sit in front of tables
are often part of a mostly uninteresting office job or questionable political
mongering, Charlie&rsquo;s table was possibly the most profound table in all of the
western world. It was a table of democracy; of debate.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/age_of_weimarica/prove_me_wrong.jpg"></p>
<p>One would think, then, that such a milquetoast, kind &ndash; if maybe a bit strange
&ndash; American conservative would have been assassinated, that his death would not
leave any room for interpretation of whether or not he deserved getting slain
like cattle, destined to bleed out and traumatise millions of people worldwide.</p>
<p>I was proven wrong immediately. Demonic cackles and many voices of individuals
possessed by Satan started howling throughout nearly every conceivable media
channel in the world. Like the bells of a church, they celebrate his death,
calling it a well-deserved fate, and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/top-university-administrator-calls-charlie-kirk-assassination-fair-stance-on-guns-no-prayers">that everyone who prays for him or his
family is a right-wing weirdo and a
loser</a>.
Closer to home in Europe, Amrit Kaur, the leader of Red Party Youth Norway,
<a href="https://www.vg.no/nyheter/i/73Wyv9/roed-ungdom-leder-vitset-om-charlie-kirk-drapet">sarcastically voiced how terrible it is that Charlie has been
murdered</a>.
Social media, such as Reddit, is brimming with memes such as &lsquo;debate lost&rsquo; or
&lsquo;he should not have had such a big head in PVP zone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is important that we need to hate the sin, but not the sinner. These
individuals are possessed by Satan, meaning that they are not in control of
their actions. They are all humans, made in the image of God. Do not let
resentment or bitterness over their actions develop in you.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the USA is entering a period that bears a disturbing resemblance
to 1920s and early 1930s Germany &ndash; better known as the Weimar Republic. The
parallels are not in policy, but in spirit. The Weimar years were defined by a
crippling economic depression and a deep sense of national humiliation that
created a fertile ground for extremism. A weak and distrusted democratic
government found itself caught between two armies of true believers: the
communists who aimed to tear it all down for a workers&rsquo; revolution, and the
rising nationalist right who sought to purge the nation and restore a mythical
past. In this fractured landscape, political solutions became impossible, and
the stage was set for war.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/age_of_weimarica/weimar.webp"></p>
<p>When debate dies, the street becomes the arbiter. The political violence of the
Weimar Republic was not abstract; it was disturbing and brutal. It was a war of
clubs against knives. Communists, organised in their own paramilitary wings,
would descend upon the fascists and club them to death. The Brownshirts, in
turn, would retaliate with daggers and assassinate communist leaders in the
streets. The conflict was so ritualised that it inscribed itself onto the very
bodies of the combatants. It was said that in the city hospitals, you could
tell a man&rsquo;s ideology by his injuries. If he was covered in bruises from blunt
force trauma, he was a fascist. If he was bleeding from stab wounds, he was a
communist. Sometimes the job would be finished in the hospitals, too.</p>
<p>The most terrifying sign of a collapsing society is not the violence itself,
but the disappearance of neutral ground. The war in Weimar Germany did not
respect the walls of a hospital. Political enemies would hunt each other down
in the wards, finishing off the wounded men they had failed to kill on the
pavement. A place of healing became just another battleground. This was the
final stage of the collapse, where the institutions meant to uphold
civilisation &ndash; medicine, law, order &ndash; became extensions of the political
fight. Any semblance of a shared society had vanished. There was only the tribe
and the weapon.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/age_of_weimarica/wounded_soldier.webp"></p>
<p>If, then, Charlie Kirk &ndash; a man whose entire career was built on non-violence
and dialogue &ndash; is executed for his speech, what hope remains for the USA? His
assassination is a terrifying answer to the question of what happens when
debate is no longer possible. While we in Europe watch from across the
Atlantic, we must ask if this is a purely American sickness or a contagion that
will spread. We should hope for the best, of course, but this is not a good
sign. When a society is already straining under the kind of economic misery
currently gripping the US American people, the first political murder is never
the last.</p>
<p>An assassination of a political figure in a fractured nation is never just a
murder; it is a signal. It can be a catalyst. We saw this in 1994, when the
assassination of the Hutu President of Rwanda, Juvénal Habyarimana, was used as
the trigger for the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Rwanda-genocide-of-1994">systematic genocide of the Tutsi
minority</a>. That gave
the killers permission to begin the slaughter. While the context is different,
the principle is the same. Charlie&rsquo;s murder sends a clear message to the most
radical elements of the left: political violence is now on the table. The
Rubicon has been crossed&hellip; or maybe it hasn&rsquo;t. This uncertainty is
specifically why Charlie&rsquo;s assassination disturbs not just the Christian world,
but reasonable non-Christians alike.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a strong indicator for why this may be a sign of very bad times
to come is the fact that the celebration of Charlie&rsquo;s death is not something
that appeared overnight. That is, the people celebrating did not wake up on 9th
or 10th September and thought to themselves, &lsquo;<em>Man, these right-wing nutjobs
really are subhuman. I really hate them. I hope they will be tortured and
killed.</em>&rsquo; These people, who seemed ordinary, coming from all walks of life &ndash;
bureaucrats, medical workers, McDonald&rsquo;s staff &ndash; had these opinions for years,
or decades. It is only just now that their presence is on full display, and it
is horrifying.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the reign of a tyrant ends when he dies. When a martyr dies,
Christ&rsquo;s presence only magnifies, which is why this incident is bringing out
the demons. This is why his death, while a crushing tragedy for his family, is
also a severe mercy for the rest of us. It is a divine clarification. In the
coming Age of Weimarica, the satanic temptation will be to fight the war on the
world&rsquo;s terms &ndash; with the club and the knife, with hatred and bitterness.
Charlie’s martyrdom is a call to reject this temptation. It is a call to
boldness, a command to abandon the lukewarm faith that is so easily surrendered
when the pressure of worldly affairs mounts.</p>

<p>Do not cry for Charlie Kirk. He has won his crown. Weep instead for a world
that murders its peacemakers. Then, pick up the weapon he wielded: a love so
radical it is willing to speak truth to those who hate you, knowing it may cost
you your life. We were not called to live in fear or to win political battles,
but to be a faithful witness to Christ&rsquo;s Resurrection unto death, and unto the
ages of ages. In an age of terror, that is the only path to eternal life, and
the only victory that matters.</p>
