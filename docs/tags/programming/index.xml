      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of programming languages, but often they are talked of in terms of what realistic applications they&#xA;have in the job market. Seldom is there prose about their quality as such; independent of their popularity and&#xA;application. Here&amp;rsquo;s some of my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;quality-versus-utility&#34;&gt;Quality versus utility&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As most software engineers know, there is not really any correlation between the quality of a language and its&#xA;popularity. There is however a correlation between popularity and utility. Python might not be the best language ever&#xA;made, but any design flaws it has are offset, in the eyes of most, by the fact that it has libraries for everything.&#xA;Why? Because it is in top three most popular languages, somewhere around C and Java. Therefore any issue one might&#xA;encounter probably already has a complete solution in the form of a third-party library. This means that Python has&#xA;extremely high utility, even if there are design issues with the language that can get in the way of common usage;&#xA;while writing code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
