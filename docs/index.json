[{"content":"I am a proud European, but, a lot more than that, I am also a citizen of the Republic of Poland. Watching what is happening west of us is difficult to put into words. When watching nations, that were formerly the greatest empires to have ever existed in human history \u0026ndash; The British Empire, The German Empire, The French Empire \u0026ndash; systematically orchestrating their own annihilation, you cannot just accept that at face value. You are forced to rationalise it. You invent comforting lies to explain why your neighbors are systematically eradicating their own kind. You have to do that, since they are your neighbours, who are nice. To readily accept and dispassionately observe their downfall would be a cruel betrayal of our good and long-lasting relationships.\nAt the same time, we cannot let blind optimism get in the way of facts. For me at least, the denial phase is over. What the western countries of Germany, France, UK, and many others are doing is, unmistakably, suicide on a civilisational scale. I think many people throughout 2024, and particularly 2025, were holding their breath for the critical state of affairs to dissuade the political elite class from further pursuing the policies that are causing the downfall of Europe. What we are seeing instead is doubling and tripling down on policies that drive a stake through the heart of Europe. Let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at some of the things that happened over the past few years, although some of them have been in the making for decades.\nThe anatomy of the collapse Anti-tank barriers erected in front of a Christmas market in Bonn, 2025. Very festive. From DW.\nGermany needing to erect anti-tank barriers in order to protect its citizenry from Islamic terrorism. Most cities in 2024 and 2025 have abstained from organising Christmas markets (a long-standing German tradition), due to the enormous costs involved in paying for security.\nThe French economic stagnation, political instability, and growing debt is also apparent, even if slow-burning (or burning out, rather). However, it is not as bad as with our continent\u0026rsquo;s powerhouse, Germany. Everything in Europe, for the better or worse, is downstream from Germany.\nGermany\u0026rsquo;s production output dropping by 4.3% in August compared to July. For comparison, the average monthly production decline during the Great Depression of 1929-1931 was 1-1.5% per month. Even those sorts of numbers were not seen during the 2008 mortgage crisis. Overall, Germany\u0026rsquo;s production output has regressed to 2004-2005 levels, effectively undoing 20 years of progress. This is because German leadership bet on two things:\nEliminating all \u0026ldquo;unclean\u0026rdquo; sources of energy, including nuclear energy. I believe I don\u0026rsquo;t have to offer an elaborate explanation for why Germany, a nation of steel and petrochemistry, requires large amounts of energy. Relying on Gazprom to provide the oil and gas required to produce energy and drive the petrochemical industry. Relying on Gazprom\u0026hellip; because, according to the German Green Party, imported gas is somehow \u0026lsquo;cleaner\u0026rsquo; than domestic atoms. Just don\u0026rsquo;t think about it too much, OK? The world is ending, we don\u0026rsquo;t have time to think that hard. A horrifying map showing the decline of Europe better than words ever could.\nBut when the lights begin to flicker and the factories go quiet, the state must ensure that the citizens do not complain too loudly. The death of prosperity invariably requires the death of free speech. This is why the German political elite is continually edging towards banning the only dissenting party in Bundestag, Alternativ für Deutschland (AfD). The official reason is that they are \u0026ldquo;far-right extremists\u0026rdquo;, whatever that means, but the real reason is of course because they are the only party that represents the German people\u0026rsquo;s interests. Every other party is more interested in representing Gazprom, another government, or some other foreign interest.\nGoing to the other side of the pond: not even 24 hours after it was made effective in late July of 2025, UK\u0026rsquo;s Online Safety Act \u0026ndash; officially only for protecting children from harmful online content \u0026ndash; was used to block access to voicing political dissent of its citizenry. For instance, British citizens voicing concerns about the mass murder happening in Gaza, perpetuated by the Israeli military, or the violence happening in their own country. Even Wikipedia, broadly a Marxist-leaning source of information to begin with, is branded by its telecommunications authority as a \u0026ldquo;high-risk service\u0026rdquo;. This type of authoritarianism has not been seen in western Europe since 1945, but we are not seeing any sanctions against the UK by the continental powers. This is interesting, considering the EU applied sanctions on Belarus for only slightly more direct repression in 2020.\nI could go on and on, but I think everyone gets the idea. To some extent, everyone in Europe is aware of the ponderous decline that is currently ongoing, although I think a staggering amount is still ignorant about its true scale. No matter how bad one believes it is, the reality is a lot worse.\nAccidentally resurrecting the Sino-Russian alliance Even real aggressors \u0026ndash; not helpless citizens \u0026ndash; like Russia, with its invasion of Ukraine, are fought incompetently. Consider the situation from a strategic perspective: The West has engaged in a war of economic attrition against a resource-rich autocracy, yet it did so after voluntarily dismantling its own industrial base and energy independence, Germany largely surrendering it to them. We are attempting to choke the Russian bear while our own hands are trembling from hunger.\nThe sanctions, with the intended goal of subduing Russia, have instead achieved two effects, both of them directly opposed to the interests of the West:\nAccelerated the German economic decline that was already happening as a result of the 2008 mortgage crisis and suicidal domestic energy policies. With Gazprom\u0026rsquo;s partial counter-embargo at the start of the invasion, the German economy was wrecked. Brought Russia closer to China. The Chinese, and also the Indians, do not care all that much for the West\u0026rsquo;s opinion on Russia. This means that, while Russian oil and gas prices have indeed declined sharply since 2022, China gets discounted oil and gas. It is not a coincidence that in 2025 a total of over 50,000 employees were fired in the automotive industry. While some very naive and delusional people might be triumphantly celebrating Russian stocks and shares taking a dip, President Xi Jinping could not possibly have hoped for a more beneficial outcome for China\u0026rsquo;s continually growing global dominance. Just check out the prices for original polyethylene or polypropylene on Alibaba, then compare them with originals from Germany. You will see what I mean. Russian President Vladimir Putin shakes hands with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing . From Al Jazeera\nAs if that was not bad enough, the West has pretty much guaranteed Putin will rule until the day he dies. That is, the West, even with the cooperation of the ostensibly neutral Swiss authorities, have seized all assets of Russian oligarchs that allegedly were in support of Putin. I am not an expert in billionaire politics and autocratic government internals, but even I know that, if you want to have any chance of actually dethroning Putin whatsoever, you will not want to disarm the people closest to him. By seizing their assets in London, Paris, and New York, the West did not bankrupt the war machine. Instead, we burned the oligarchs\u0026rsquo; escape boats. Before the sanctions, these men had one foot in Moscow and one foot in the West. Now, with their foreign assets frozen and their reputations destroyed, they have nowhere left to go. Their physical and financial survival now depends entirely on their loyalty to the Kremlin. We did not create a wedge between the dictator and his elite; we welded them together. We effectively purged Putin’s potential rivals for him, streamlining an autocracy that might otherwise have crumbled under its own corruption. Genius!\nThe US is tired, the dragon rises While the US has massive problems on its own \u0026ndash; heading towards a steady decline \u0026ndash; by virtue of its natural resources and large population, it will always be an important player in global politics. For the better or worse (usually worse), their foreign policy has major impact on business in Europe.\nHowever, I cannot bring myself to disagreement when I hear Donald Trump proclaiming that he is tired of Europe. Him calling us a \u0026ldquo;decaying\u0026rdquo; empire is the kettle calling pot black, but I think we can all agree that European leaders display extreme weakness:\nThe US threatened to invade Greenland, yet we still have not jettisoned the US as an ally. What ally threatens invasion? Why even need enemies then? If we accept this, we are weak. All of our tech infrastructure still depends almost entirely on US American tech infrastructure. In all these years, neither Germany nor any other European country has set up their own Linux distribution. Are we really not able to replicate North Korea with its Red Star OS? This is also pathetic. What Prime Minister Donald Tusk said: \u0026ldquo;The paradox is that 500 million Europeans are asking 300 million Americans to defend them against 140 million Russians. We must rely on ourselves, fully aware of our potential and with confidence that we are a global power\u0026rdquo;. As said, the US is also on its way out. At the beginning of 2025, Donald Trump tried to show muscle in front of Xi Jinping, by declaring a trade war on the entire world, especially China. Unfortunately, with China constituting 90% of global rare earths output, the US Americans found out the hard way that they will not wallop the eastern dragon any time soon. Burning your last bridges with the only other superpower in the world is not a recipe for lasting hegemony.\nThe sun sets in the West, but rises in the East If the United States is pivoting to the Pacific to wrestle with the dragon, and Western Europe is committing slow-motion suicide in a fit of green hysteria and self-loathing, where does that leave us? Are we entering a post-European world?\nIf you define \u0026ldquo;Europe\u0026rdquo; by the sclerotic bureaucracies of Brussels, the de-industrialised husks of the Ruhr valley, or the censorship regimes of London, then the answer is an emphatic yes. That world is walking dead. It is a zombie civilisation that has not yet realised it has stopped breathing. It is a world that hates its own history, fears its own strength, and silences its own citizens.\nGeography is stubborn, however. The continent does not vanish just because its traditional leaders have overdosed on champagne.\nAs a Pole, I look around and I do not see the end of civilisation. I see a transfer of it. The center of gravity is shifting from the Rhine to the Vistula, if I dare say something so bold. While the Bundeswehr is spending millions on pregnancy uniforms for its female soldiers, Poland is building the strongest land army on the continent. While British police arrest citizens for posts on Twitter, the nations of the Intermarium \u0026ndash; from the Baltic to the Black Sea \u0026ndash; retain a living memory of what totalitarianism actually looks like, and we have no desire to return to it, whether it comes wearing a Soviet red star or a corporate rainbow lanyard.\nThe values that made Europe the envy of the world; industry, rational faith, liberty, and the willingness to defend one\u0026rsquo;s home; have not vanished into the ether. They have simply migrated East. The old powers are obsessed with GDP, yet are hysterically unable to raise it, while making life a waking nightmare for everyone. They have forgotten that history is a meat grinder that does not care about your GDP or your European Charter of Human Rights if you lack the steel to defend them.\nWe are entering a post-Western-European world. The task now falls to Warsaw, Budapest, Bucharest, and the Baltic capitals to realise that no cavalry is coming from the West. We are the cavalry. Here, on the edge of the steppes, we have a duty to keep the fire burning. We must stop looking to Berlin and Paris for validation. I don\u0026rsquo;t think they have anything left to teach us but how to die. Instead, we must look to ourselves. Maybe partner up with the Chinese, who knows? They seem well-behaved.\nThe game is not over. The board has just changed. For the first time in three centuries, the pieces are ours to move. What a time to live in.\n","permalink":"https://maxwelljensen.eu/posts/post_european_world/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI am a proud European, but, a lot more than that, I am also a citizen of the\nRepublic of Poland.

He was positioned approximately 200 metres away from Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA (TPUSA). Charlie sat in his iconic \u0026lsquo;Prove Me Wrong\u0026rsquo; tent, seated in front of a table, where he would invite university students to debate him. It was one of the many ordinary tours that Charlie was well-known for, having done them since the age of 18.\nIn the debate that was ongoing, a student asked Kirk a question about transexual school shooters. \u0026lsquo;Do you know how many mass shooters there have been in America over the last 10 years?\u0026rsquo; Kirk replied with a question. \u0026lsquo;Counting or not counting gang violence?\u0026rsquo; The student did not have time to provide clarification. At the age of 31, Charlie\u0026rsquo;s life was extinguished as the assassin discharged his weapon, striking Charlie in the neck, opening his jugular vein. Having had the misfortune of reviewing footage of the moment of the strike, I was almost immediately aware that his death would follow moments later. I was also deeply disturbed. His wife Erika had become a widow and his two children became fatherless. His last word on this planet was \u0026lsquo;violence\u0026rsquo;, and violence there was.\nArizonans mourn Turning Point USA Founder Charlie Kirk outside the Turning Point USA headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona.\nFor whatever reason, despite never having known or cared that much about Charlie\u0026rsquo;s work, I felt as though the world had become a suddenly much worse place. Much worse than it already is, that is. It was later that I learned from people all over the world \u0026ndash; including patristic voices in Eastern Orthodox Church that I am part of \u0026ndash; that Charlie\u0026rsquo;s entire career had been not just about pushing for MAGA and other political topics particular to the USA, but also a powerful voice in the global Christian world. Granted that he was an Evangelical, a branch of Protestantism, so not in my church, but our doctrine has never been to pretend heretics don\u0026rsquo;t exist or that they don\u0026rsquo;t deserve love. Everyone deserves love, including non-Christians. Not empathy, which is a word often abused by the godless to mean a fake form of love that is conditional in nature; selfish; not love. Charlie displayed love.\nMore importantly, Charlie Kirk was brave. Braver than I could ever possibly have been. Simply the prospect of going to a super-leftist university campus is enough to instil anxiety in me. Setting up a table to debate people who disagree with you on every topic, who find your belief in Christ contemptible? Not for me, I would never do it. But Charlie Kirk did that. He went there, because if he did not have belief in Christ, he had belief in one thing: reaching out those who disagree with you with a calm voice, respect, and utmost love. This is a common ground that even most hardline atheists can stand on. His entire career was built on this principle. That is what TPUSA is. He was not an undeserving lobbyist, a run-off-the-mill politician, or an extremist demagogue. Whatever money he earned, he earned it through a platform of being respectful and preaching moderate views. Whether he sincerely held these views is irrelevant. I did not care much for his political views either, they were fairly milquetoast.\nBut his love for youth was unmatched. Where most people saw aspiring future workers or scientists, Charlie saw warriors for Christ who could become a lot more. Warriors whose sword and shield are the good news and the Lord, with the ability to not just reshape the world, but secure their own salvation. Nobody tended to the youth in the US the way Charlie did. He was the last remaining vestige of anything approximating sanity on atheistic and mostly radical leftist university campuses.\nI would go so far as to say, Charlie Kirk was probably the only person in the 21st century to truly embody the concept of freedom and democracy as it is taught to us at public school. The only person to go to people, who often hated him on a personal level, who vilified him, yet never once even raise his voice, resort to violence, or belittling those he viewed as opponents. As far as the cameras \u0026ndash; which have been rolling for 13 years \u0026ndash; are concerned, Charlie Kirk showed Christlike respect upon all atheists and leftists. While the careers of people who sit in front of tables are often part of a mostly uninteresting office job or questionable political mongering, Charlie\u0026rsquo;s table was possibly the most profound table in all of the western world. It was a table of democracy; of debate.\nOne would think, then, that such a milquetoast, kind \u0026ndash; if maybe a bit strange \u0026ndash; American conservative would have been assassinated, that his death would not leave any room for interpretation of whether or not he deserved getting slain like cattle, destined to bleed out and traumatise millions of people worldwide.\nI was proven wrong immediately. Demonic cackles and many voices of individuals possessed by Satan started howling throughout nearly every conceivable media channel in the world. Like the bells of a church, they celebrate his death, calling it a well-deserved fate, and that everyone who prays for him or his family is a right-wing weirdo and a loser. Closer to home in Europe, Amrit Kaur, the leader of Red Party Youth Norway, sarcastically voiced how terrible it is that Charlie has been murdered. Social media, such as Reddit, is brimming with memes such as \u0026lsquo;debate lost\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;he should not have had such a big head in PVP zone.\u0026rsquo;\nIt is important that we need to hate the sin, but not the sinner. These individuals are possessed by Satan, meaning that they are not in control of their actions. They are all humans, made in the image of God. Do not let resentment or bitterness over their actions develop in you.\nNevertheless, the USA is entering a period that bears a disturbing resemblance to 1920s and early 1930s Germany \u0026ndash; better known as the Weimar Republic. The parallels are not in policy, but in spirit. The Weimar years were defined by a crippling economic depression and a deep sense of national humiliation that created a fertile ground for extremism. A weak and distrusted democratic government found itself caught between two armies of true believers: the communists who aimed to tear it all down for a workers\u0026rsquo; revolution, and the rising nationalist right who sought to purge the nation and restore a mythical past. In this fractured landscape, political solutions became impossible, and the stage was set for war.\nWhen debate dies, the street becomes the arbiter. The political violence of the Weimar Republic was not abstract; it was disturbing and brutal. It was a war of clubs against knives. Communists, organised in their own paramilitary wings, would descend upon the fascists and club them to death. The Brownshirts, in turn, would retaliate with daggers and assassinate communist leaders in the streets. The conflict was so ritualised that it inscribed itself onto the very bodies of the combatants. It was said that in the city hospitals, you could tell a man\u0026rsquo;s ideology by his injuries. If he was covered in bruises from blunt force trauma, he was a fascist. If he was bleeding from stab wounds, he was a communist. Sometimes the job would be finished in the hospitals, too.\nThe most terrifying sign of a collapsing society is not the violence itself, but the disappearance of neutral ground. The war in Weimar Germany did not respect the walls of a hospital. Political enemies would hunt each other down in the wards, finishing off the wounded men they had failed to kill on the pavement. A place of healing became just another battleground. This was the final stage of the collapse, where the institutions meant to uphold civilisation \u0026ndash; medicine, law, order \u0026ndash; became extensions of the political fight. Any semblance of a shared society had vanished. There was only the tribe and the weapon.\nIf, then, Charlie Kirk \u0026ndash; a man whose entire career was built on non-violence and dialogue \u0026ndash; is executed for his speech, what hope remains for the USA? His assassination is a terrifying answer to the question of what happens when debate is no longer possible. While we in Europe watch from across the Atlantic, we must ask if this is a purely American sickness or a contagion that will spread. We should hope for the best, of course, but this is not a good sign. When a society is already straining under the kind of economic misery currently gripping the US American people, the first political murder is never the last.\nAn assassination of a political figure in a fractured nation is never just a murder; it is a signal. It can be a catalyst. We saw this in 1994, when the assassination of the Hutu President of Rwanda, Juvénal Habyarimana, was used as the trigger for the systematic genocide of the Tutsi minority. That gave the killers permission to begin the slaughter. While the context is different, the principle is the same. Charlie\u0026rsquo;s murder sends a clear message to the most radical elements of the left: political violence is now on the table. The Rubicon has been crossed\u0026hellip; or maybe it hasn\u0026rsquo;t. This uncertainty is specifically why Charlie\u0026rsquo;s assassination disturbs not just the Christian world, but reasonable non-Christians alike.\nUnfortunately, a strong indicator for why this may be a sign of very bad times to come is the fact that the celebration of Charlie\u0026rsquo;s death is not something that appeared overnight. That is, the people celebrating did not wake up on 9th or 10th September and thought to themselves, \u0026lsquo;Man, these right-wing nutjobs really are subhuman. I really hate them. I hope they will be tortured and killed.\u0026rsquo; These people, who seemed ordinary, coming from all walks of life \u0026ndash; bureaucrats, medical workers, McDonald\u0026rsquo;s staff \u0026ndash; had these opinions for years, or decades. It is only just now that their presence is on full display, and it is horrifying.\nNevertheless, the reign of a tyrant ends when he dies. When a martyr dies, Christ\u0026rsquo;s presence only magnifies, which is why this incident is bringing out the demons. This is why his death, while a crushing tragedy for his family, is also a severe mercy for the rest of us. It is a divine clarification. In the coming Age of Weimarica, the satanic temptation will be to fight the war on the world\u0026rsquo;s terms \u0026ndash; with the club and the knife, with hatred and bitterness. Charlie’s martyrdom is a call to reject this temptation. It is a call to boldness, a command to abandon the lukewarm faith that is so easily surrendered when the pressure of worldly affairs mounts.\nIcon of The Resurrection of Lord Jesus Christ. Not even death has dominion over Him.\nDo not cry for Charlie Kirk. He has won his crown. Weep instead for a world that murders its peacemakers. Then, pick up the weapon he wielded: a love so radical it is willing to speak truth to those who hate you, knowing it may cost you your life. We were not called to live in fear or to win political battles, but to be a faithful witness to Christ\u0026rsquo;s Resurrection unto death, and unto the ages of ages. In an age of terror, that is the only path to eternal life, and the only victory that matters.\n","permalink":"https://maxwelljensen.eu/posts/age_of_weimarica/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eOn 10th September 2025, a shooter climbed onto the roof of a building at Utah\nState University, Utah, USA.

What is public school? In Europe, one most often does not think about school in terms of whether it is public or private, at least at the primary level. In Europe especially, public school is considered such an integral part of life that simply saying \u0026lsquo;school\u0026rsquo; in the context of primary education is immediately understood. In places like Norway, private primary education is not even legal. This also means that public school is seldom examined critically.\nBut why is it important whether or not school is public or private? Why is that a necessary distinction? The distinction is in history, so let\u0026rsquo;s dive into it.\nPublic education did not become a serious proposition until the latter half of 19th century. That century was the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, which we feel the effects of to this day. The world hegemon at that time was the British Empire, sometimes also known as the empire upon which the sun never sets. If it was night in the British Isles, it was day in Singapore and Hong Kong. If it was night in New Zealand and Australia, it was day in British Caribbean. It was an enormous network of territories spanning a quarter of the globe.\nBritish Empire at its greatest extent in 1901.\nThis raises an obvious question: how could the British Empire possibly maintain such an empire without the Internet or airplanes? The electrical telegraph did start rolling around by 1850, but it is of little help if your population is comprised largely of illiterates; small pool to draw bureaucrats from. According to Henry E. Cowper\u0026rsquo;s 1979 Ph.D. thesis, the answer is that they didn\u0026rsquo;t. The Italian Empire formed in 1869, the German Empire formed in 1871, and soon enough other countries started picking up this new hot thing called industrialisation. This meant fierce competition. The British Empire could no longer play it slow. In fact, they had some of the least educated citizenry in Europe. They had to pick up speed, but all of their strength laid in their dominions, which were all spread out throughout the globe. You could not control all of that with a few bureaucrats in Westminster. Rather, you needed bureaucrats in all the dominions, who are capable of independent calculation, assessment based on scholarly knowledge, and innate understanding of the protocols of trade and customs.\nState-funded education, then, was the solution. The goal was not to foster creativity, critical thinking, or individual genius. It was to solve a massive human resources problem. The British Empire required a standardised, interchangeable class of administrators, clerks, and officers who could be relied upon to execute orders, maintain ledgers, and uphold the system without question, whether in London, Calcutta, or Hong Kong. It needed to mass-produce cogs for its vast imperial machine. The educational system that arose from this need was, therefore, designed with industrial efficiency in mind. Its primary aim was not the enlightenment of the individual, but the production of compliant and functional human components to serve the needs of the state and its sprawling commercial enterprises.\nTo achieve this industrial-scale production of bureaucrats, the system’s architects required a blueprint for mass conditioning. They found a perfect one in the most efficient and celebrated institution of their age: the factory. The internal logic of the public school is not the logic of the ancient Lyceum or the Renaissance studio; it is the logic of the assembly line. The ringing of bells to signal the start of a lesson, a break, or the end of the day was not an academic innovation. It was a factory innovation, designed to discipline a workforce and habituate them to the tyranny of the clock. Students were not grouped by intellectual curiosity or aptitude, but batched by their \u0026lsquo;manufacture date\u0026rsquo;, which was their age, and moved through a standardised process, from one subject station to the next, for a predetermined amount of time. The curriculum itself became a set of specifications for a uniform product: a citizen with a baseline of literacy and numeracy, ready to be slotted into a role. It was the perfect solution to maintain British supremacy over the continental wannabes.\nThis factory model, designed for efficiency, necessarily created an environment of coercion and rigidity. The physical layout of the classroom was optimised for surveillance and top-down instruction: rows of silent workers (students) facing a single foreman (the teacher). This was not the environment for exploration or discovery. The highest virtues were those of the factory floor or the military barracks: punctuality, obedience, and the silent completion of repetitive tasks. Critical thought, creativity, and dissent were not just unrewarded, they were liabilities to the operation. Which one? Of the grand empire. Not yours, stupid.\nOf course, as with many things, this development was not exclusively negative. Rarely is this the case. Even the atomic bomb paved way for the best method of generating energy there is.\nIndeed, the alternative to this new citizen factory was often the very real anguish of low-wage plebeian labour. Brutal labour. While Britain was engineering a system to produce compliant clerks, nations like Norway, contrary to any romantic notion of rustic Scandinavian life, actually made use of child labour to a greater extent than Sweden, Britain, or the United States. Before the state saw children as future bureaucrats, factory owners saw them as cheap labour, and nowhere was this more apparent than in the tobacco and matchstick industries. According to Statistics Norway research, a staggering 42 percent of the workforce in tobacco factories were children; in matchstick production, it was 35 percent. They were sent into these facilities to be exposed to toxins so potent they caused a condition known as \u0026lsquo;phossy jaw,\u0026rsquo; where the white phosphorus would literally rot the bone from their faces.\nFaced with a generation being physically disintegrated by industry, the state’s intervention with compulsory education looks less like an act of enlightenment and more like a pragmatic reclamation of a valuable resource. The research of Jakob Neumann Mohn, who chronicled this horror and would build the cornerstone of Statistics Norway, became the state\u0026rsquo;s blueprint. The explicit goal, in his own words, was \u0026ldquo;at beskytte Manden i Barnet\u0026rdquo;, or to protect the Man in the Child. Whether or not this was a sentimental plea is up for debate, but Mohn\u0026rsquo;s calculus was clear: a child maimed in a factory is a net loss to the state, incapable of becoming a productive worker or a competent soldier. He argued that child labour suppressed adult wages by creating a class of desperate competitors, and that it destroyed the workforce before it could even mature. The establishment of public schooling, therefore, was a strategic pivot. The state wrested control of children from the factory owners, pulling them from the chaotic brutality of the assembly line and placing them onto the structured, disciplined production line of the public school. It was a choice between two factories, but one of them didn\u0026rsquo;t actively dissolve your bones.\nIn the 20th century, the Norwegian Sami were subjected to a Norwegianisation policy with the goal of assimilation. The photo shows Sami children at a boarding school for migrant Sami children in Karasjok, 1950. The teaching was in Norwegian. I had to include something mean here, after all.\nNow to the present. One would expect a lot to have changed over the course of 120-150 years. Usually, these sorts of developments undergo truly radical transformation over such long spans of time. The early Mercedes-Benz that Hitler rode is nothing like the latest 2025 C-Class. The electrical telegraph is now the Internet, a technology eclipsing its origins to such an extent that the remaining continuity is purely conceptual.\nAs we all know, however, the public school remains almost entirely unchanged from the early 20th century. The same organisation of classrooms remains. The bell still rings to signal the start and stop of playtime. With time, some countries even banned private alternatives to public primary education, as mentioned earlier.\nIn fact, I am going to argue that public schools have become worse in some significant ways since the times of Industrial Revolution. The chief of which is the formation of unisex schools. Contrary to what a fringe minority of deranged people would like us to believe, there are profound and inseparable differences between boys and girls. For instance, boys better learn visually, whereas girls through relationships. This is why comic books are popular with boys, whereas novels are popular with girls.\nGirls mature at a faster rate than boys, and kind of just grow up to be women automatically, whereas a man is needed to turn a boy into another man. This is an especially pressing concern that, as far as I know, has never been addressed at any school in the west. I am sure there are lucky classrooms that have masculine teachers who are strong in character to guide both the boys and the girls towards not just educational success, but personal success. In my case, I have had nothing but melancholic teachers who clearly struggled with finding any joy in their work, perhaps even their lives as a whole. Most of them were women as well, clearly woefully untrained to deal with (often unique) problems that arise in boyhood.\nWhat, then, is the practical result of this one-size-fits-all model, this deliberate ignorance of fundamental biology? The system, by default, ends up optimised for one sex at the expense of the other. The modern classroom prizes quiet compliance, orderly group discussion, and emotional introspection \u0026ndash; a matrix of behaviours that aligns far more naturally with the developmental trajectory of girls. A boy’s innate drive for kinetics, competition, and tangible problem-solving is not seen as a different learning style, but as a behavioural problem. He is not channelled; he is pathologised. His inability to sit still for six hours is suddenly not a failure of the environment, but a defect in his brain chemistry, for which there is, conveniently, a medical diagnosis and a pill. The factory has simply been retooled to produce a different kind of compliant citizen, one neutered of the very masculine energy that built the empires in the first place.\nAnd who oversees this retooling? This system is overwhelmingly administered by women. This is not a failure of individual female teachers, many of whom are undoubtedly dedicated and competent, but a catastrophic failure of institutional design. A boy, who requires the firm example of a man to navigate the path to manhood, is instead left in a world of almost exclusively feminine authority during his most formative years. The few men who remain are often not the strong role models needed. They are the ones who haven\u0026rsquo;t quit despite truly lousy wages when compared to all other professions. From the boy\u0026rsquo;s perspective, school ceases to be a place of education and becomes an engine of weird social engineering, setting you on a path that you don\u0026rsquo;t understand. I didn\u0026rsquo;t understand why I had to read novels either, until only a few years ago. Turns out, I had to do it because it was never meant for me, it was for the girls.\nWages (in percentage of yearly average income) for certain sectors in Norway between 1970 and 2010. Pink line is education. It was 115% in 1970, in 2010 it was 97%. Source is Statistics Norway.\nOf course, there are a few scholarly domains where sitting down and boring yourself with the details is the only way of learning an important topic. There are only a limited amount of ways of teaching mathematics in a way that imparts the needed mathematical skill.\nMathematics, chemistry, physics: these domains demand a foundation of brute-force memorisation and abstract logic. Few dispute this, but this is only a fraction of what a well-rounded school entails. What of history, of religion, of the arts? These are the realms of human drama, of epic struggle, of heroism and betrayal. Yet how are they presented? The thunder of legions and the ambition of emperors are reduced to a dry analysis of socioeconomic factors, or poetry nobody cares about. The great epics that were meant to forge a boy\u0026rsquo;s character are not even shown in class. Instead, we got tedious explorations of patriarchal power structures, or emotional inspection of a woman\u0026rsquo;s view on feminism, or something like that. These are all examples from my cloudy memory, mind you. Cloudy not because my memory from childhood is poor, but because these literary works really, really sucked.\nThis is where the model collapses into true psychological cruelty. When a boy is force-fed a curriculum that is not merely uninteresting but actively hostile to his masculine inclinations, he does exactly what a prisoner does: he rebels. Yes, we are finally getting to the title. He becomes disruptive, he disengages, he seeks distraction. And the system, in its profound lack of self-awareness, blames him for its own failure. The factory has thus perfected its design. It is no longer just a physical prison of bells and schedules; it has become a psychic prison, an environment engineered to alienate a boy from his own nature and convince him it is a pathology. The walls are no longer just brick and mortar; they are built from a curriculum that denies him heroes and a social structure that denies him masculine role models.\nThe dynamics of a prison and of the modern public school are eerily similar, but I will do you one better: prison has more positives over the public school. Let\u0026rsquo;s draw some parallels.\nIn a public school, you are there because you have to be there. Well, technically in places like Norway and most other countries, there is a duty to educate, not duty to send to school. However, given that most Norwegian parents do not have the personal resources for homeschooling, and private alternatives are banned, pretty much everyone gets sent to public school. With how fragmented, individualistic, and hyper-liberal modern western societies have become, you have kids in one place who come from radically divergent backgrounds, to the point where there is nothing fundamentally binding them together. Mass migration has made even ethnic basis a challenge. Decline in church life weakened family and community units. Basically, the entire place becomes a borderline mental asylum of idiosyncrasies, that the teachers often have few resources to handle, simply don\u0026rsquo;t care to handle, or maybe are even disallowed from intervening at all. God help you if your mother tongue is not Norwegian.\nMeanwhile, in a prison, you actually have a lot in common with the other prisoners right out of the gate: you have sinned. Depending on the severity of your crime, there are no pretences that someone is below you or above you, that their family is different from yours, or that your mother tongue is not native. Of course, there is a large difference between most European prisons and what\u0026rsquo;s essentially a mass isolation chamber of El Salvador where most MS-13 gang members are destined to sit out the rest of their lives in complete silence, while being fed slop. In this essay, I am chiefly talking about Norwegian prison.\nThis fundamental difference in social cohesion leads to a second, more profound distinction: the presence of a clear, albeit brutal, code of conduct. The social landscape of a school is a jungle of unwritten rules, shifting alliances, and psychological warfare. Cliques form and dissolve, bullying is rampant but often subtle, and a student’s status can be destroyed by a rumour. It is a world of constant, low-grade anxiety governed by the whims of the immature. I speak from experience. A prison, by contrast, operates on a rigid and explicit hierarchy. The rules are harsh, and the consequences for breaking them are immediate and violent, but they are known. There is a brutal honesty to this system. Your place is understood, and navigating the environment, while dangerous, is a matter of understanding a clear (though unwritten) code. It is a world that demands situational awareness and respect for power; a harsh but straightforward lesson that is arguably more useful than navigating the chaotic emotional minefield of the schoolyard.\nFurthermore, let\u0026rsquo;s consider the stated purpose versus the practical outcome. A school\u0026rsquo;s purpose is \u0026rsquo;education,\u0026rsquo; an abstract goal that for many boys translates into years of forced compliance with subjects they find meaningless. They leave with a diploma, perhaps, but few tangible skills that lead to self-sufficiency. A modern Norwegian prison, however, has a concrete and tangible purpose: rehabilitation. An inmate is often given the opportunity to learn a trade; to become a carpenter, a welder, or a mechanic. They can acquire practical, marketable skills in an environment that understands the value of tangible work. The school takes a boy, forces him to sit still, and lectures him on poetry. The prison takes a man, acknowledges his sins, but also need for purpose, and hands him a tool. One system prepares you for a life of abstract thought and bureaucratic compliance; the other can prepare you to actually build something, maybe even your own character. Absolutely nothing builds character like true repentance.\nThat is why, when someone told me that he knows several ex-convicts who preferred prison over school, I did not require further elaboration. I understood immediately why they said that. Now, when someone asks what the point of public schools is, if you can be taught most of the essentials at home, the usual answer I heard is, \u0026ldquo;For the social aspect.\u0026rdquo; Maybe people who respond this way have had a good time. I am not in a position to deny someone else\u0026rsquo;s anecdotal experience with my own testimony, but here are the things I was taught from social interaction at school:\nThat you cannot trust anyone. Friendships are spontaneous, fleeting, subject to unsigned contract agreements. To hate other people. I have screamed at many students in bouts of unfiltered rage. Not to open yourself up too much to other people. That I am the problem, everyone else is correct. I was actually once berated by a teacher in high school for finding issue with music being played by a student in the middle of an ongoing lesson. To become addicted to pornography. If I was to be constantly anxious and on the verge of mental collapse, the natural outlet was pornography, readily accessible through the Internet. Francis Bacon\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lsquo;Head VI.\u0026rsquo; An accurate depiction of what the \u0026lsquo;social aspect\u0026rsquo; of school feels like.\nIn my mind, this is the actual social curriculum. It is a fifteen-year masterclass in navigating a world without honour, a practicum in mistrust, and a seminar on the management of your own simmering resentment. When confronted with this reality, the assertion that ex-convicts might prefer the brutal honesty of a prison yard to the psychological warfare of the schoolyard ceases to be shocking. It becomes perfectly logical. A prison acknowledges the prisoner is broken and, in its best modern form, offers a some kind of path to rebuilding through repentance. The public school, in its current form, takes a healthy boy, convinces him that his own nature is a pathology, and offers him only compliance as a cure. One system breaks your body but can offer to rebuild your character; the other slowly grinds your character down and has the audacity to call it education.\nNearly every single insecurity that I have as a person is in some way tied to or originates from my years at public school. It was not until I was baptised at the Eastern Orthodox Church that I really started to understand the depth of my wounds (and evil). All of what I learned about socialisation had to be undone through over a decade of self-discovery, self-reflection, bitterness, anger, and confusion, before I really got an appreciation for the depth of the damage I received from school. I have mostly healed from all this damage, but I can still feel the subconscious fear when I walk by someone on the street if they stare at me for too long. If the 19th century public schooling system was a bureaucrat factory, the 21st century public school is a trauma factory.\nTo be clear, I am not implying that public school is the source of all evil in the world; that by eliminating it, we institute a utopia. In the modern world, there is an uncountable amount of ways to wound oneself, and still many other ways in which wounds are forced upon us. I am still quite grateful that I got the opportunity to learn how to read, write, do math, learn about some important history, and many other things that I still find use for in my life.\nHowever, if there is one thing we should pray for every day, is that we do not witness more events like the one on 2nd April 2024 in Vantaa, Finland, where a 12-year-old stole his father\u0026rsquo;s weapon, took it to school, and murdered one of his peers. Clueless parents said, \u0026ldquo;We need to control guns better!\u0026rdquo; I said, \u0026ldquo;My God, it is a miracle our children are not terminated like this every single day.\u0026rdquo; I know, because this 12-year-old could have been me.\n","permalink":"https://maxwelljensen.eu/posts/public_education_prison/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAs always, before we get to meat of the matter, let\u0026rsquo;s first establish the\nterms.

They might not use it, they might not have an idea of what it even is, but they are certain to be aware of the term. Among those who don\u0026rsquo;t know the particulars, they are largely indifferent. Those who are more technologically literate and curious about the technology, however, might have a strong opinion about it. People who don\u0026rsquo;t have a strong opinion about AI are just regular people. People who are convinced that AI is not just an industrial revolution, but something that will change the entire fabric society as we know it, we call the pro-AI cult. On the opposite side, we have people who say that AI will not do any of that, but rather cause the psychic, economic and creative death of the world as we know it; the anti-AI cult.\nWhat is AI? Before we get to any pro or anti cults, politics, legal issues, or whatever else concerning AI, let\u0026rsquo;s establish what AI even is. The term appeared seemingly out of nowhere, yet is now the backbone of every new startup in the Silicon Valley and elsewhere. The brand name ChatGPT is well on its way to replacing Google as stand-in for searching or extracting information from the Internet. Google-fu is getting replaced by prompt engineering, and so on. But what is it? What is the furore? Clearly, it cannot be actual intelligence, right?\nIn a very, very short and only somewhat reductive summary: AI is a word prediction algorithm on steroids.\nHowever, that is not a very useful description, and might even seem very incorrect. After all, if AI is just a \u0026lsquo;word prediction algorithm on steroids,\u0026rsquo; why are not just millions, or even billions, but trillions of US dollars getting poured into this technology across the globe? United Nations Trade and Development projects that market capital on AI technology might soar to near five trillion US dollars by 2033. With this in mind, it would be prudent to more exactly specify what AI is.\nFirst of all, let\u0026rsquo;s establish the basics. The name \u0026lsquo;artificial intelligence\u0026rsquo; is simply a marketing term that has no basis in the underlying technology. This is because, for a start, AI is not a single technology, but a wide swathe of technologies that use a common concept, but radically different implementations for different tasks: large language models (LLMs), image recognition models, diffusion text-to-image models, visual document retrieval models, and many, many more types. Given what was just said, it stands to reason that those terms are not very marketable to the average consumer, so the name \u0026lsquo;artificial intelligence\u0026rsquo; was picked instead. For rich people, it was great. For researchers who want to do actual work and science free of marketing hype, it was an unmitigated disaster.\nSecondly, the concept that makes up AI is not intelligence. In fancy terms, it\u0026rsquo;s about pattern recognition and generation at a scale that is impossible for the human brain to comprehend. Let’s take one of the most controversial (among a demographic of people I will get to later) types of AI: the generative adversarial network, or GAN. This is the technology that, for years prior to the explosion of ChatGPT, powered the \u0026lsquo;deepfake\u0026rsquo; videos and hyper-realistic faces of people who don\u0026rsquo;t exist.\nUnderstanding a GAN is surprisingly simple if you think of it not as a computer program, but as a game between two bots: an art forger and an art detective.\nGenerator (\u0026lsquo;The Forger\u0026rsquo;): This bot\u0026rsquo;s only job is to create fakes. Imagine it starts by throwing random paint splatters on a canvas. It has no idea what a \u0026lsquo;Mona Lisa\u0026rsquo; is. It just creates noise. Its goal is to create a painting that the detective will believe is a real, lost masterpiece.\nDiscriminator (\u0026lsquo;The Detective\u0026rsquo;): This bot is the expert. It has been shown a massive library of every great masterpiece in history. Its only job is to look at a piece of art, either a real one from its library, or a fake from the forger, and declare \u0026lsquo;Real!\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;Fake!\u0026rsquo; It\u0026rsquo;s a seasoned art critic.\nClick to expand.\nNow, here\u0026rsquo;s where the magic happens. We pit them against each other in a relentless, high-speed battle. This battle is so intense and high-speed that it requires a lot of power from a lot of GPUs, which is why NVIDIA now has 4 trillion US dollars in market capital.\nThe Forger creates a terrible, noisy fake that doesn\u0026rsquo;t just not resemble Mona Lisa, but resembles nothing at all. The Detective looks at it for a nanosecond and says, \u0026ldquo;Fake! Not even close.\u0026rdquo; The system \u0026ndash; that is, humans \u0026ndash; tells the Forger, \u0026ldquo;That was bad. The Detective caught you instantly. Change your technique.\u0026rdquo;\nClick to expand.\nSo the Forger adjusts its strategy slightly and produces a new fake. It\u0026rsquo;s still bad, but maybe the colors are a little more coherent. The Detective looks at it. \u0026ldquo;Fake. But I had to think about it for an extra millisecond.\u0026rdquo; The system gives that feedback to the Forger: \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re getting warmer. Keep going in that direction.\u0026rdquo;\nThis process repeats millions, or even billions, of times. The Forger gets progressively better at creating convincing fakes, and in parallel, the Detective gets progressively better at spotting them. They are locked in an adversarial relationship, each one forcing the other to become smarter and more sophisticated.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s the endgame? The game stops when the Forger becomes so masterful that it can produce fakes that fool the expert Detective about 50% of the time. At that point, the Detective is essentially just guessing. The Forger\u0026rsquo;s creations are now indistinguishable from the real thing, at least in the eyes of the system. We can then take this masterful Forger, throw away the Detective, and use it to generate an infinite stream of novel, high-quality \u0026lsquo;art\u0026rsquo;.\nClick to expand.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t intelligence in any meaningful sense, obviously. The Forger doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel inspiration, have any innate understanding of beauty, or anything of the sort. It is just a program that has been perfected through a computationally brutal game of competition. That is how a powerful algorithm can be produced, which allows previously impossible things.\nReality and the pro-AI cult As we can see, conceptually GANs are fundamentally nothing different from any other computer program. The only difference from GANs compared to conventional computer programs is that GANs require an astonishing amount of data to learn from and computational power to run.\nMicrosoft datecentre located in Cheyenne, Wyoming, United States. It consumes many terawatt-hours every year, which is required to develop and run AI. More on this topic.\nAnd as was mentioned, there are two cults that are obsessed with AI and vehemently opposed to everything related to it. The reason why this article will focus mainly on the anti-AI cult is because the pro-AI cult, sometimes also collectively called \u0026rsquo;techbros,\u0026rsquo; is more or less good at making itself look ridiculous already. Not much explanation is needed for why outsourcing thinking to AI is a very, very bad idea, or why substituting a would-be human girlfriend for AI is, again\u0026hellip; a very, very bad idea.\nEven for more practical tasks, discretion and expertise is required. For instance, a recent platform, called Tea, which was a dating platform designed exclusively for women \u0026ndash; complete with government ID verification process \u0026ndash; was trivially hacked. The issue? It is highly likely that the platform was \u0026lsquo;vibe-coded\u0026rsquo; by highly inexperienced individuals, which led to the database being exposed to the public. All that was needed was finding the public URL to it \u0026ndash; which was found \u0026ndash; and the rest is history. The pseudo-programmers behind Tea \u0026lsquo;vibe-coded\u0026rsquo; it, meaning that they used AI to essentially do all of the work for them. If they were more involved in the actual technical details of the project, they would see that the database program was screaming at them with obvious alerts, explaining that their database is publicly available at a given URL. In other words: AI is not a substitute for skill and paying attention.\nOf course, there are some real serious benefits to AI technologies. The most notable example is that AI deployed at UK\u0026rsquo;s National Health Agency is better at detecting cancer from body scans than its oncologists are. An actual life-saving implementation! Indeed, there are many ways in which AI is generally beneficial. At the same time, the hype around AI is more than likely a bubble. So far, despite sky-high valuations that have propelled companies like NVIDIA past the GDP of most nations, clear and sustainable profits remain elusive for much of the industry. For all the talk of world-changing potential, the business models often boil down to burning through billions in venture capital to subsidise services in a race for market share: a strategy that reeks of the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. Back then, \u0026lsquo;user growth\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;disruption\u0026rsquo; were prized over actual revenue, leading to an inevitable and spectacular crash. The current AI boom, fueled by what looks a lot like irrational exuberance, is showing similar cracks. This economic shakiness makes the pro-AI cult\u0026rsquo;s utopian promises seem even more unhinged, which is why I don\u0026rsquo;t really think they warrant a dedicated refutation.\nEnter the anti-AI cult Now we turn to the main subject: the anti-AI cult. If the pro-AI cult is defined by a naive, almost childlike faith in technology, the anti-AI cult is defined by a deep, conspiratorial paranoia. To them, AI is not a tool, however flawed. It is a parasitic, soul-sucking digital monster, birthed from theft and destined to bring about a creative and economic apocalypse. Their gospel is one of doom, their sermons filled with warnings of stolen art, mass unemployment, and the psychic death of human creativity.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s be fair: some of these fears are rooted in legitimate anxieties. The question of how AI will impact jobs is a serious one, and the legal and ethical frameworks around data and copyright are struggling to keep pace with the technology. These are important conversations.\nHowever, the central dogma of the anti-AI cult \u0026ndash; the emotional engine that drives their movement \u0026ndash; rests on a profound misunderstanding of the technology they so passionately despise. Their entire argument is built on a single, powerful, and fundamentally emotional premise that has no basis in legality or logic.\nStolen art! The most common and emotionally charged accusation is that AI steals from artists. The narrative goes like this: AI companies scrape billions of images from the Internet, many of them copyrighted, and feed them into a model without the artists\u0026rsquo; consent. Therefore, any image the AI generates is, according to them, a Frankenstein\u0026rsquo;s monster of stolen parts, an act of automated plagiarism on a planetary scale.\nThis is a common narrative. It is also wrong. The anti-AI argument treats the AI like a digital kleptomaniac, stuffing its hard drive with stolen JPEGs to stitch together later.\nIn order to understand why this is not the case, we have to define what plagiarism actually is. Plagiarism is governed by copyright laws, which I go into some detail in my other article. In short terms, plagiarism is creating something that is not creatively distinguishable from another artist\u0026rsquo;s work, or simply redistributing the work. This is wrong, which is why it is illegal in almost the entire world.\nDoes AI fulfil this legal definition of plagiarism? No. For context, an AI model is typically 1-100 GB of data, which is not nearly enough to contain the terabytes (TBs) or petabytes (PBs) of data that companies use to train said models. Obviously, an AI model cannot redistribute all the works of the world in that small amount of space. This simple fact of data compression proves that the AI is not a giant zip file of stolen images. Instead of storing copies, the model learns the statistical patterns and relationships between concepts.\nTo put it back in human terms, the AI is not a plagiarist; it is a student. When a human art student studies the works of Rembrandt, they are not storing a perfect photographic copy of The Night Watch in their brain. They are learning about chiaroscuro, composition, and how to render the texture of velvet and steel. When they later paint a portrait using those learned techniques, we don\u0026rsquo;t accuse them of stealing from Rembrandt. We call it being influenced by Rembrandt. The AI does the same, only it is a student that has studied the visual library of all of humanity. It learns the concept of cat from millions of pictures of cats, not by memorising any single one.\nThis brings us to the most crucial failure in the anti-AI cult\u0026rsquo;s logic: the inability to distinguish between a tool and the actions of a user.\nLet’s consider a tool that artists have used for decades: Adobe Photoshop. With Photoshop, I can create a breathtaking, original digital painting from a blank canvas. I can also use it to take another artist\u0026rsquo;s work, clumsily erase their signature, and claim it as my own. I can use the clone stamp tool to remove elements, or the lasso tool to collage parts of copyrighted photographs into my work. Has Adobe created a plagiarism machine? Should we ban Photoshop because it can be used to infringe on copyright?\nThe question is absurd on its face. We understand that Photoshop is a tool. We hold the user accountable for their actions. If someone uses it to plagiarise, they are the plagiarist, not Adobe. If a big studio decides to plagiarise with Adobe Photoshop, we blame the studio, not Adobe. If a big company like Midjourney publishes a tool that accidentally allows you to recreate plagiarised content, we blame\u0026hellip; all of AI, instead of telling Midjourney to fix their programming error? Alright.\nAI is no different. It is simply a new paintbrush. A person can use this paintbrush to create something entirely novel and transformative. A different person, with malicious intent, could try to use this same paintbrush to replicate a specific artist\u0026rsquo;s style so closely that it borders on infringement. In that case, who is to blame? The paintbrush, or the person holding it?\nThe call to ban AI because of its potential for misuse is a fundamental category error. It is like demanding we ban cameras because they can be used to take pictures of copyrighted material, or banning the Internet because it can be used to distribute pirated files. It is nothing different from the outrageously stupid \u0026ldquo;You wouldn\u0026rsquo;t download a car\u0026rdquo; PSA of the early 2000s that played at the beginning of nearly every DVD film.\nThe anti-AI cult’s refusal to see this distinction is not based on logic or law, but on fear. Interestingly, given that AI art is often generic and mediocre, shouldn\u0026rsquo;t that fear be more indicative of the artist who is outraged over it, rather than AI? Food for thought.\nThe psychic death of creativity? That final thought leads us to the second great dogma of the anti-AI cult: the fear that AI will not just steal jobs, but will destroy the very essence of human creativity. The argument is that if anyone can generate a \u0026lsquo;good enough\u0026rsquo; image by typing a few words, the value of real skill, honed over years of practice, will evaporate. Art, they claim, will become a cheap, instantly gratifying commodity, and the human soul of the artist will be rendered obsolete.\nThis is, again, a compelling and deeply emotional fear. It is also, historically, a fear that has been proven wrong every single time a new creative technology has emerged.\nWhen the camera was invented in the 19th century, painters panicked. The French artist Paul Delaroche, upon seeing an early photograph, famously declared, \u0026ldquo;From today, painting is dead!\u0026rdquo; Why would anyone spend weeks on a painted portrait when a machine could capture a perfect likeness in minutes?\nBut painting did not die. The camera did not kill it. By freeing painters from the burden of perfect realism, the camera forced them to ask a new question: what can painting do that a photograph can\u0026rsquo;t? The answer was an explosion of creativity that gave us impressionism, expressionism, surrealism, and many more. The camera \u0026rsquo;took the job\u0026rsquo; of pure representation, and in doing so, it pushed human artists into new, more expressive, and more abstract territories. It didn\u0026rsquo;t devalue human skill; it forced it to evolve.\nAI is the new camera. It automates the technical rendering, the digital brushwork. It can produce a generic, technically proficient image on command. But it has no intent, no vision, no story to tell. It has no lived experience, no heartbreak, no joy. Anti-AI cultists often say this as some kind of checkmate, even to people who are obviously not in any way associated with the pro-AI cult. Everyone who isn\u0026rsquo;t part of either cult is keenly aware it is a tool or a novel amusement piece, and is treated as such.\nJust like art schools of the 19th and 20th century, there\u0026rsquo;s a non-trivial amount of artists today who are gatekeeping elitists that refuse to adapt. The hills they will die on are often absurd to anybody who is not strongly opinionated about AI. In my opinion, the most eye-rolling AI outrage is about advertisement getting \u0026lsquo;invaded\u0026rsquo; by AI. Ah, yes, won\u0026rsquo;t somebody think of the advertising companies? Won\u0026rsquo;t somebody pity the artists who are no longer forced to make graphics for obnoxious unsolicited content? \u0026ldquo;What we really need more of in our lives is human-crafted advertisement\u0026rdquo; is a hill that some anti-AI cultists are willing to die on. Doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound like defending creativity to me.\nThis defensive gatekeeping is the mark of an artist who fears their own mediocrity, not the sign of a true visionary. Can anyone seriously imagine a towering talent like Vangelis, a man who wrangled entire orchestras from a wall of synthesisers when that technology was in its infancy, being threatened by AI? The thought is laughable, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? A true master doesn\u0026rsquo;t fear a new instrument; they are hungry to master it. Vangelis would have either ignored AI as an amusing toy irrelevant to his vision, or he would have bent it to his will to create sounds and compositions we can\u0026rsquo;t even dream of. The outrage comes not from the giants, but from those who fear their own art sucks. In my experience, it often does.\n\u0026ldquo;AI is bad for society\u0026rdquo; You know what else is bad for society? Pornography and social media. I am not setting up a whataboutism here, like \u0026ldquo;Why don\u0026rsquo;t you care about this other, unrelated issue?\u0026rdquo; strawman, which is a lazy pseudo-intellectual rebuke. Rather, what I want to highlight is how societal attitude to the Internet is an all-around cataclysm that has ruined the lives of many people \u0026ndash; particularly children \u0026ndash; long before any of this silly AI outrage. Parents should not be letting their children use TikTok, or Facebook, or the Internet at all. The Internet is simply not good to use by the weak-minded.\nIf your goal of limiting or eliminating widespread use of AI is to protect society from \u0026lsquo;brain-rot,\u0026rsquo; preventing children from abusing it or being abused by it, or anything of the sort, then you are simply barking up the wrong tree.\nThe moral panic surrounding AI seems like a convenient distraction. It allows people to fixate on a new sci-fi villain instead of confronting Moloch already living in our house: the attention economy and its devastating consequences on the human psyche. The psychological damage wrought by algorithmically-curated social media feeds on children is immense, with European Union Joint Research Centre pretty much saying that your brain actually will rot under its influence. The polarisation in society driven by engagement farming is also quite self-evident. The exploitation inherent in data collection \u0026ndash; the list goes on. These are not future threats, they are the horrifying realities of our present. The anti-AI cult performs outrage over the potential for a robot to write a mediocre or plagiarised advertisement, while turning a blind eye to the very real, documented harm caused by the platforms on which that outrage is performed. They scroll through five hundred clips of playdough ASMR and pornographic content on TikTok, only to tweet outrage when one of the clips briefly contains an AI-generated image. It\u0026rsquo;s lunacy.\nConclusion: beyond the cults This misplaced moral panic of the anti-AI cult is almost as ridiculous as the hysteria of violent video games or film piracy. By fixating on the tool instead of the culture, they divert energy and attention away from the real fight. Instead of demanding robust legal frameworks for data transparency from all tech companies, or banning decisively bad abuses of technology like pornography on the Internet, they demand a category of programs be banned; to prohibit GANs. Instead of advocating for educational reform to promote the critical digital literacy needed to navigate our toxic information landscape, they promote fear and outrage. They are trying to solve a 21st-century problem of information warfare with a 19th-century impulse to smash the machines. Thanks to that, the European Union has signed the AI Act, which essentially all it did was surrender any prospects of European economic supremacy to the US and China.\nSo we are left where we started: with two warring cults. On one side, the pro-AI cult, with its naive faith in technological salvation, blindly outsourcing its thinking and ending up with hacked dating apps and nonsensical business plans. On the other, the anti-AI cult, preaching a gospel of doom, demanding we unplug the future because they believe they are fighting the last war.\nBoth are wrong. Both substitute hysteria for reasoned debate.\nThe real path forward is to grow up. It\u0026rsquo;s to stop treating computer technology like it\u0026rsquo;s not just a binary sequence of zeroes and ones, and start seeing it for what it is: a tool. Very powerful, yet indifferent, and therefore a dangerous tool that demands skill, wisdom, and discipline from its users.\nThe anti-AI cult fears a future where creativity, or whatever else, is devalued by a flood of generic, machine-made content. But by refusing to engage, by choosing to scream from the digital sidelines instead of picking up the tool and pushing its boundaries, they are ironically helping to create the very future they fear. In those situations, it\u0026rsquo;s not a matter of winners versus losers. It\u0026rsquo;s a matter of those who scream at reality itself, expecting it to change, versus those who adapt to life and learn to deal with it. That\u0026rsquo;s just how it works.\n","permalink":"https://maxwelljensen.eu/posts/debunking_anti_ai_cult/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eBy now, almost everyone in the industrialised world is aware of something known\nas \u0026lsquo;AI,\u0026rsquo; or \u003cem\u003eartificial intelligence\u003c/em\u003e for short.

For reference, this was so far back that the EU didn\u0026rsquo;t even exist yet. It was only the Economic European Community (EEC) back then. Narrowly, the population voted about 53% nay. There was another referendum, a lot more recently, in 1994. That time, it was even more narrow, with 52% voting nay. Sweden, which had referendum at around the same time, voted 53% yay instead, and became a member of the EU. This raises a perfectly obvious question: was the Norwegian public wise in these two landmark decisions? Clearly it is not a cut-and-dry issue, as all that decided the outcome was only about 100,000 people. If 100,000 more people were convinced that EU would be to Norway\u0026rsquo;s benefit \u0026ndash; rather than to its detriment \u0026ndash; Norway would have been an EU member in either 1972 or 1994. Let\u0026rsquo;s examine this more closely.\nFirst of all, let\u0026rsquo;s identify what motivated the decisions in either referendum of the general public of Norway. According to Statistics Norway (Statistisk Sentralbyrå), the key fear of those voting nay in either referendum was loss of autonomy. Even back in 1972, when the EU was not a fully political union yet, 81% of those voting against EU membership cited this as a key factor in their decision. Even bigger portion still simply did not see any benefits, at 84%. Interestingly, even of those who voted positively for EU membership, 64% feared that EU membership would invite entry of foreign workers and foreign interests into Norway. In other words, even those who were receptive to EU membership were aware that some kind of compromises were pending, but saw that the advantages outweighed the perceived negatives.\nAnother factor for the outcome of both referendums was the rural-urban divide, with the rural Norway overwhelmingly voting against EU membership. In summary, key fear of the rural people was that piling Brussels on top of Oslo as an authority would overwhelm the \u0026lsquo;rural class\u0026rsquo; of people, overriding their every decision or wish. As someone from Mandal who prefers rural life, I can resonate with this fear, even if I still think it was misplaced. In my experience, Brussels or not, the government is going to have its way with you.\nResults of 1994 European Union referendums in Norway and Sweden. Statistics based on Statistics Norway.\nThese voter motivations more or less align with what I know from Norwegians, as someone who lived there my whole life. Throughout many conversations about Norway\u0026rsquo;s status in the world, I have repeatedly heard the following two words come up: independence (uavhengighet) and liberty (frihet). For example, why should Norway categorically ban imports of all potatoes forever? Because Norwegian farmers need to be free from foreign intervention and tyranny of cheap competition. In one particular case, I even heard the argument that Norwegians are uniquely the best people in the world when it comes to not wasting any food from grocery1, such as Coop or REMA 1000. According to that person, inviting competitors from abroad, such as LIDL or Aldi, would undermine this culture of saving food from waste. As a consequence, cultural independence and liberty of Norway would be infringed. Basically, the idea of \u0026lsquo;independence and liberty\u0026rsquo; permeates the entire public conscience when it comes to foreign policy.\nBut that was the situation as seen by the general public of Norway. Let\u0026rsquo;s move onto the essential questions regarding the reality of Norway\u0026rsquo;s current situation as a non-EU member. What does Norway actually get out of not being in the EU?\nIt does not take much review to conclude that Norway is forced to play smart politics if it is to exist in Europe outside of the EU. The cornerstone of this strategy is the European Economic Area (EEA) agreement (EØS-avtalen), a deal that grants Norway access to the EU\u0026rsquo;s single market. This is, on the surface, the best of both worlds. Norway gets to trade freely with its largest partners, while remaining, officially, the master of its own house. But this arrangement has given rise to a uniquely Norwegian political problem, often described with the pejorative term fax democracy2. The term illustrates the reality of the situation: Norway receives laws from Brussels, as if by fax, and is obligated to implement them into its own legal code, all without (usually) having a single minister, representative, or even a junior aide at the table where those laws were drafted and voted upon.\nThis is not a trivial matter of conforming to a few trade standards. By some estimates, Norway has adopted roughly three-quarters of all EU legislation through the EEA agreement. This has led to the profound irony that in its quest for \u0026lsquo;independence,\u0026rsquo; Norway has arguably surrendered more legislative power than it would have as a full member. As a member, it would have voting rights, the power of veto on key issues, and a seat in the European Parliament to shape the very laws it now passively accepts. On top of this, Norway pays hundreds of millions of euros to the EU each year for this market access; a fee without without representation. While the nay side can correctly claim victory in protecting key sectors like agriculture and fisheries from direct EU control, one must ask if the trade-off was worth it. Has Norway truly protected its independence and liberty, or has it simply exchanged a seat at the table for a stool in the hallway?\nOf course, critics of this view have valid rebuttals. They will argue that the quarter of EU legislation Norway doesn\u0026rsquo;t adopt makes all the difference, particularly for cherished industries like fisheries and farming. They might also claim that Norway retains crucial \u0026lsquo;wiggle room\u0026rsquo; in how it implements the laws it does accept. And they are not wrong. These exceptions and implementation details are significant. Yet, to focus on them is to miss the forest for the trees. The true cost of Norway’s arrangement isn\u0026rsquo;t found in the fine print of EEA directives, but in its silent shackles on the world stage.\nWhat are those shackles? To understand, consider Hungary under Viktor Orbán. Now, one can vehemently disagree with Orbán\u0026rsquo;s politics \u0026ndash; as many in Norway and across Europe do \u0026ndash; but it is impossible to deny his effectiveness at using EU membership as a tool for his own national agenda. From a position of full membership, Orbán has repeatedly shaped, delayed, or outright blocked EU-wide decisions until his demands were met. He has used Hungary\u0026rsquo;s veto power as a powerful lever to extract concessions and advance his vision. Hungary does not even need powerful resources like oil and gas, as Orbán has a voice in the EU Council, and he uses it. For example:\nIn January 2025, Orbán linked his support for extending EU sanctions on Russia to Ukraine reopening the transit pipeline for Russian gas. Despite Hungary holding the rotating EU Council presidency, Orbán traveled to Moscow in July 2024 to meet Vladimir Putin, without any EU mandate. EU leaders rebuked him for supposed appeasement and stressed he did not represent the bloc’s foreign policy position At a summer event in July 2025, Orbán warned he would torpedo the EU’s next seven-year budget unless Brussels unlocked billions in cohesion funds suspended over rule-of-law concerns. His ultimatum highlighted his willingness to use Hungary’s unanimity vote as leverage. Viktor Orbán (left) meeting Vladimir Putin (right). From BBC News\nNorway, in contrast, has no such lever. When the EU formulates a common foreign policy on everything from climate change to relations with Russia or China, Norway can only watch from the sidelines. It cannot play the spoiler, build a blocking coalition, or anything of the sort. As an economically ponderous petro-state, Norway definitely cannot leverage oil and gas. Wielding its oil and gas reserves as a political weapon, in the style of an embargo, is simply not in the nation\u0026rsquo;s political DNA. The Norwegian television thriller Occupied (Okkupert) vividly imagines the disastrous outcome if Norway were to pursue such a bellicose foreign policy. A nation of five million people, however wealthy, would be swiftly brought to its knees by giants like the EU, the US, or China.\nPut another way, one could think back to the times Julius Caesar. Before he became emperor, he invaded Gaul and burnt its civilisation down to the ground. Despite being a fairly advanced civilisation, with fearsome warriors, the Gauls stood little chance against the much-better organised and powerful Roman Legions. Very little could have been done to prevent Gaul\u0026rsquo;s demise, but one thing that absolutely would have stopped all of Caesar\u0026rsquo;s ambitions would be simple: joining the Roman Republic.\nLuckily, the EU is nowhere near as fearsome as Julius Caesar and his Legions, but the same principle applies in Norway\u0026rsquo;s situation. The point also isn\u0026rsquo;t to advocate for Norway to lead an aggressive foreign policy, where they threaten everyone with everything, including an oil embargo and the kitchen sink, if they don\u0026rsquo;t get their way. Current Norwegian foreign policy is more or less smart, even without EU in the picture. What is important to know, however, is that the current foreign policy isn\u0026rsquo;t implemented just because the Norwegian people want it: they have to implement it, lest they face seriously unpleasant consequences. Is this not by definition lack of independence and liberty?\nFor fifty years, this trade-off may have seemed acceptable. Norway\u0026rsquo;s immense oil wealth and the stability of the post-Cold War era created a comfortable buffer, making true political engagement feel optional. But the world is changing. With the USA\u0026rsquo;s suicidal foreign policy alienating European allies and the geopolitical ground shifting under everyone\u0026rsquo;s feet, the idea of standing alone is starting to look less like a proud choice and more like a dangerous vulnerability. Recent polls and analyses suggest that Norwegians are beginning to notice.\nThe core of the Norwegian dilemma has never been about paying fees to Brussels or the regulation of potatoes. It has always been about what self-determination is. The referendums of 1972 and 1994 answered the question for their time, choosing an ideal of liberty defined by separation; between rural and urban, and Oslo and Brussels. The question now is whether that definition still holds. In the turbulent decade to come, real independence may not be found in isolationism, but in the strength, influence, and security that comes from having a seat at the table. Only time will tell if a new generation of Norwegians will be forced to ask themselves the same question their parents and grandparents did, and whether they will arrive at a different answer.\nAs an aside, this is completely untrue. 450,000 tonnes of food is wasted every year across Norway.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThis article actually argues against the point I am making, but I thought I would include it to offer fair and nuanced representation of EU critics as it relates to Norway.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://maxwelljensen.eu/posts/norway_vs_eu/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAs far back as 1972, Norway had a referendum on whether or not to join the\nEuropean Union (EU).

I was born and raised in Norway, but my story begins in Poland. My father was a naval officer from Gdańsk who sought asylum in Norway in 1986, and my mother immigrated from Zambrów in 1996.\nThe goal here is to share some insights that might be relevant to Norwegians, or really, anyone who finds multicultural exchanges interesting. We all know we live in a world of global exchange \u0026ndash; not just of goods, but of ideas and culture. With this short essay, I hope to offer some insights and constructive criticism that everyone can use to expand their worldview. While I don\u0026rsquo;t believe that simply importing people of fundamentally incompatible cultures constitutes a valid social policy, I do believe every culture offers at least one thing that can widen our perception of the world for the better. And let me be clear, this is a two-way street: my life in Norway has had a formative, profoundly positive impact on how I view the world, which I will get into later.\nIf we don\u0026rsquo;t open up our minds \u0026ndash; or at least give a cursory glance \u0026ndash; to how other people do things, we might end up like the Americans. Notice how Americans enjoy films, but generally only if they are made in Hollywood. If a film is set in a foreign place, it\u0026rsquo;s almost always through the lens of an American protagonist. Even one of their most popular films set in Shogunate Japan is about Tom Cruise as a samurai. This insularity can have amusing consequences, like when the New York Stock Exchange incorrectly hoisted the Swiss flag to announce Spotify\u0026rsquo;s listing \u0026ndash; an error made by people who likely spent more on their education than you spent on your house. You get the idea.\nNow, is that such a big issue? Actually, yes. An insular society can develop some unhealthy blind spots. For instance, a 2019 Pew Research Center study showed that many Americans believe any form of government intervention in the social sphere would undermine democracy. Both those who view \u0026ldquo;socialism\u0026rdquo; negatively and those who view it positively in the USA seem to understand the term only through brief history lessons about the Soviet Union and some headlines about Venezuela. It’s easy to see how simply exposing oneself to foreign cultures, even through films, would dispel such an ill-conceived and almost childishly simple understanding of basic concepts. A few films about Europe \u0026ndash; not through Tom Cruise, but actual Europeans \u0026ndash; would quickly make them understand that, no, we are not \u0026ldquo;socialist\u0026rdquo; countries in that sense. It is no wonder there is so much misery and confusion in the USA when people simply don\u0026rsquo;t know any better.\nCulturally and socially, Norway is not in such a dire state, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean there isn\u0026rsquo;t room for improvement, or that Norwegians don\u0026rsquo;t live in some kind of bubble. Ultimately, we all do. It\u0026rsquo;s only a matter of extent. By no means do I consider myself some learnt world traveler; I speak only three languages and have never travelled outside of Europe.\nThere are many reasons why I decided to move to Poland. Not all of them are related to the cultural or political situation in Norway, but they are a big factor. They are too numerous to list here, so I will focus on the most relevant.\nWhy did I move to Poland? Let\u0026rsquo;s start with a simple, economic reason that everyone can understand: the real estate situation in Norway. For my generation, it is, to put it bluntly, absurd beyond belief. As a result of the 2008 mortgage crisis, Norway implemented extreme austerity measures that should have been lifted years ago. The biggest of these is the limitation of a mortgage to five times your annual income. This was a reasonable measure in the wake of the crisis, but after more than a decade, it has resulted in a crippled real estate market.\nFrom Bloomberg\nBecause of this extremely tight mortgaging limit, companies were forced to build only the housing people could afford within that narrow margin. Five times your annual income is not a lot. Combine that with a fragile fiat currency brought to its knees by a regional conflict or a US presidential election, overall claustrophobic economic regulation discouraging foreign investment, and you have a real estate nightmare on your hands. Even if the government lifts this limit, it will take at least a decade for the market to recover as prices will shoot up for the foreseeable future.\nConsidering I am 29 years old, I am not waiting until I am nearing retirement before I have a chance of applying for a mortgage on a regular house. And no, my wife is not going to be forced to work for a mortgage. This led me to a startling thought: if a medieval peasant six centuries ago could afford a place to live \u0026ndash; working as little as 120 days a year \u0026ndash; then I should be able to afford a decent house with a regular job in the 21st century. Nobody is going to convince me this is normal. Mortgaging in the first place is an aberration, a deep perversion of modern economics. The Catholic Church1 expressly forbids usury, as it is a sin. This isn\u0026rsquo;t exclusive to Norway, of course, but here the situation is exceptionally bad for my generation. The fact that dual income is an essential prerequisite should cause far more outrage than it does.\nPoland was the only country in Europe that had economic growth during the 2008 crisis. Its real estate situation is not ideal either, thanks to global inflation and other developments, but it remains sane. There are no extreme austerity measures limiting your mortgaging possibilities. You can afford a mortgage with one income. For this reason alone, I struggled to see a future in Norway.\nThis has wider personal ramifications. Attracting a suitable spouse becomes immediately more difficult if you do not have a house, at least in a country like Norway where two-generation households are the norm. In many other countries, like Poland and Spain, multi-generation households are common. Having your parents in the house with your kids has immense benefits. Daycares in Norway are necessary only because both parents are forced by the perverted economy to work, and there are no other adults in the house to take care of the children. This isn\u0026rsquo;t just about necessity; it\u0026rsquo;s a different social model. Why should a stranger take care of your children? Food for thought.\nOf course, there is more to life than economics. I do not live by work, or how much cool stuff I can buy on AliExpress, but I thought I would start with something that \u0026ndash; at least I think \u0026ndash; should be the most readily digestible for the common reader. Let\u0026rsquo;s move onto more meaningful, important topics. However, I will have to compress my statements significantly, otherwise I would be writing a book, not an Internet article. Bear that in mind, in case the following statements feel superficial or incomplete.\nPerhaps the easiest way to see the difference between Polish and Norwegian culture is observing the way 17th May Constitution Day in Norway is celebrated compared to the 11th November Independence Day in Poland. Constitution Day in Norway feels more like a birthday, whereas Independence Day in Poland is more like a funeral. Somebody from Norway attending an Independence Day march in Poland might be very surprised by this, until you remember that the Polish state\u0026rsquo;s sovereignty was built on blood and sacrifice. Hundreds of thousands of young men had to sacrifice themselves so that today we can be free. The Polish Constitution is written in blood of my great-grandfathers.\nMeanwhile, with the way Norwegians celebrate Constitution Day, you would think the Norwegian Constitution was written by Coca-Cola. My intention is not to degrade the significance of the Norwegian Constitution, of course, but the celebrations are distinctly more upbeat than in Poland. This is very interesting, because Norwegian independence from Sweden in 1905 could have easily been very bloody. In fact, it is one of the things that sort of started driving me nuts when I learned of it, back when I was doing my hunter\u0026rsquo;s licence in 2023: Norwegians in the 19th century were armed to the teeth. This was the case in most of Europe, but especially Norway. The reason why Sweden didn\u0026rsquo;t invade is not because everyone in Scandinavia was oh-so-polite, but because the quintessential hobby of nearly all Norwegian men was sharpshooting. If Sweden were to invade Norway, it would be a protracted military nightmare where every window and treeline could hide a crack shot. Sure, Swedes on the general did not want war, but when has public opinion ever stopped pointless bloodshed? In other words, the Norwegian Constitution could have also been easily written in blood.\nPhoto of the Langseth shooting club from the 1950s. Taken from the digital museum of Museene i Akershus.\nAt the same time, I have almost never heard about this from any Norwegians I have been with. The old Norwegian gun culture is fascinating. One of the retired gunsmiths I spoke with said how just 30-40 years ago it was quite normal for young teenagers to carry hunting rifles in public. It did not cause any alarm. Nobody called the police to summon a SWAT team to the location. Why would it? There is nothing wrong with weapons, only people that may abuse them.\nEven today we still have Switzerland and Czechia as some of the most heavily armed nations on the planet, which do not have any more serious problems with firearms-related criminality than Germany or Norway. Yet, despite this, in a lamentable way, Norwegians allow their culture to be infected with hysteria from media and political talking points originating in the USA. My hunting instructor told me how people regularly summon the police when they hear gunfire in the nearby forest, only for the SWAT team to find \u0026ndash; to nobody\u0026rsquo;s surprise \u0026ndash; a hunter who was performing normal hunting-related activities in the forest.\nThe point here isn\u0026rsquo;t legislation or morality surrounding guns. My point here is to highlight the symptom of a deeper cultural sickness. It\u0026rsquo;s not something exclusive to Norway, of course. Poland to some extent also suffers from this, but I will get to that.\nThe image of a SWAT team descending on a lone Norwegian hunter is the perfect metaphor for a society that has become afraid of its own shadow. The farmer-sharpshooter who once guaranteed the nation\u0026rsquo;s sovereignty has been replaced by a citizen who is terrified by the very tools that secured his freedom. This citizen no longer trusts his traditional roots, or even himself. Norwegians have forgotten many aspects of their great culture. As cold as it is to say, a large chunk of Norwegian society has transformed from intrepid opportunity-seizing vikings, to largely risk-averse people of the modern world who freak out over hearing a bang in the forest.\nThe modern Norwegian tradition of rolling up to your 2,000,000 kr hytte, in a brand new Tesla on a neat access road, with tap water and electricity does not have the same ring to it.\nIn Poland, a different instinct prevails. A history of being betrayed, occupied, and erased from the map has taught Poles a healthy skepticism towards entrusting their safety entirely to outside forces, including their own state. Self-reliance is not a hobby; it’s a deeply ingrained historical necessity. The idea of calling an armed response team because you heard a hunter in the woods would be met with ridicule, because the forest and the hunter are still understood as normal parts of the landscape of life. Granted that Poles still have a somewhat irrational aversion to firearms, but I digress.\nThis allergy to risk, this outsourcing of responsibility, doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop with guns. It seeps into everything. It\u0026rsquo;s in the way children of Norway are raised in sanitised, bubble-wrapped environments, the way social discourse demands absolute conformity to avoid offence or radical changes, and the way the state is expected to provide a safety net for every poor decision. It is the slow, comfortable march towards a society of dependents, and it was a future I could not see myself in. I still held out hope that this would change, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t. If anything, it has become far worse after I resettled.\nIs Poland a super Catholic and traditional society amidst a hyper-liberal Europe? Some people would like you to believe that, but this is not true at all. Modernity has also come to Poland. With a dramatic increase in affluence \u0026ndash; possibly exceeding that of Norway as of 2025 \u0026ndash; Poles have also become drunk on modern convenience and ideals. Where before God and the Vatican was the binding glue of society, these days around Poles are largely religious only on Sunday Mass. Even then, it is up for debate how many attendees actually pay attention to the worship. Just the same as in other European countries, clothes that would have been unthinkable on an adult woman 20 years ago are now the norm for 13-year-old girls today.\nSo why do I care? What has tangibly changed in my situation, if Poland is slowly heading towards the same degree of liberalisation and ways of thinking as Norway? The answer is about trajectory and foundation. It’s one thing to be on a moving train. It’s another thing entirely to know where the train started and how fast it’s going.\nNorway’s train left the station of deep-rooted tradition long before I was born. It has been moving at full speed for 50 years, fuelled by oil wealth and insulated from the shocks that force a society to remember what matters. The journey has been so smooth for so long that the destination \u0026ndash; a society of comfortable, risk-averse dependents \u0026ndash; is not just in sight, it\u0026rsquo;s the next stop. The cultural battle is, for the most part, over. The consensus has been set. I hope I am wrong in this.\nPoland’s train just left the station. For half a century, it was stuck behind the Iron Curtain, a forced immobility that, funnily enough, preserved much of its cultural foundation. The historical memory of hardship is still fresh. The family unit is still the undisputed centre of life. Religion, even if practised with less fervour, still provides a moral bedrock that is simply absent in Scandinavia.\nMemory of those from my home town, who have given their lives for the liberation of Poland. Photo by Zambrow.org\nSo yes, Poland is liberalising. Yes, it is wrestling with the same demons of modernity. But the crucial difference is that here, it is still a wrestle. The battle is still raging. In Poland, tradition is not a museum piece; it\u0026rsquo;s an active, powerful force in the public square. The hundreds of thousands men who perished in battle are real; they move people, even if jaded by modernity. You have a choice. You can choose to live in a community that still holds to older values. You can build a life, raise a family, and find allies who believe in the same things you do. You are a participant in a living debate.\nIn Norway, that debate feels finished. The ship has sailed, and anyone who questions its direction is treated as if they want to sink it; as if they are extremists or radicals. In Poland, there are still people arguing about the map. I would rather be in a society that is still arguing about its soul than in one that has already parted with it for comfort and safety. That, tangibly, is what has changed for me. I have exchanged comfortable consensus for a meaningful conflict.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a million and one more things that I could have written about here, such as:\nThe continual demonisation of investors and entrepreneurs by the ruling politicians, for reasons that still remain entirely unknown. How the government doubled down on highest taxation in the world despite having a budget surplus equal to 14% of its GDP in 2024. Again, for reasons unknown. How the railway network has shrunk since 1945. However, this would be just rehashing the same tired point about economics and standards of living. Both of those topics are, in the grand scheme of things, fleeting and boring. This is why I choose to focus more on the intangible, incalculable things that people care about more: culture and tradition.\nMy intention is not to be polemic; to spit on Norway and its culture. Quite on the contrary, I am writing what I am writing because I am frustrated with how short Norwegians sell themselves. They can be so much more. If Norway at one point had the second-largest merchant marine in the world, why can\u0026rsquo;t they do it again? The spark is just not there anymore, yet it feels like I am the only one who takes this seriously. It\u0026rsquo;s not like I am trying to do backseat quarterbacking either: while I might not be in Norway anymore, I am most definitely going to work according to the Norwegian work ethic. I will advocate for labour unions if given the opportunity. If I see a business opportunity, I will seize it, as my host nation ancestors have done. For treating my cancer in 2019 through its public medical system, I have nothing but gratefulness for my host nation, so it is the least that I can do in return.\nThat gratitude is not platitude. It is a debt I intend to repay. This, then, is the multicultural exchange I spoke of at the beginning. It is not about abandoning one home for another, but about carrying the best of one\u0026rsquo;s heritage into the arms of another. I left Norway not because I hate it, but because I love what it once was, and what it could be again, too much to stand by and watch that spirit fade. Ultimately, my move to Poland was not an act of rejection, but an act of preservation \u0026ndash; an attempt to keep that intrepid Norwegian spark alive, even if I had to carry the torch to another shore.\nTo be clear, I am not Roman Catholic.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://maxwelljensen.eu/posts/why_i_left/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eMy name is Maxwell Jensen.

That is, if you know how to run it first, which is the hard part. This article goes through some technical details of getting certain Fedora-specific problems out of the way. Since most Linux guides regarding AI cater to Debian-based or Arch-based systems, I have found very little information on how to get some AI tools running on Fedora.\nTips my AI-generated fedora in your direction.\nAs a proud Fedora user, I will share the knowledge I gathered. My computer setup:\nOS: Fedora 41 GPU: Radeon RX 6700 XT CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 2700X RAM: 32 GB Using this, I managed to run:\nLostRuins/koboldcpp/ (LLM; text generation) YellowRoseCx/koboldcpp-rocm (LLM) oobabooga/text-generation-webui (LLM) comfyanonymous/ComfyUI (Diffusion; image generation) Getting the common dependencies There are some dependencies you will need, regardless of what kind of AI you are going to use. Thankfully, Fedora does actually have all of them available in the repositories, but they are not obvious to find. The main source of information on those dependencies is this fairly obscure Fedora Wiki page.\nROCm ROCm (short for Radeon Open Compute) is AMD\u0026rsquo;s poor answer to NVIDIA\u0026rsquo;s CUDA technology. It\u0026rsquo;s an open-source software platform designed to support high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) workloads on AMD GPUs. It includes a bunch of drivers, development tools, and APIs, but those are highly disorganised in comparison to CUDA.\nThe main piece of information to know is that the range of hardware supported by ROCm is extremely narrow. NVIDIA GPUs from 2013 or even 2011 can be used to do LLM inference. The same can\u0026rsquo;t be said about AMD GPUs. It\u0026rsquo;s only recently that it started officially supporting RDNA 2.0 cards like the RX 6700 XT. Here\u0026rsquo;s a full list of cards that are officially supported by ROCm. It\u0026rsquo;s not an impressive list. There are many unofficially supported devices. I\u0026rsquo;ve read posts on the Internet about people getting RX 580s to work with ROCm, but don\u0026rsquo;t hold your breath. ROCm is not even supported on Windows at all, at least in practice. AMD users on Windows need to use workarounds like DirectML instead.\nThat being said, you want to use ROCm at every available opportunity, as it is the fastest backend to use with AMD GPUs for any AI workload.\nShould you have an AMD GPU architecture supported by ROCm, you will need to install the following packages:\nsudo dnf install rocm-hip rocm-hip-devel rocm-hipblas rocm-hipblas-devel rocm-llvm-devel rocminfo hipblas hipblas-devel hipcc While it is not strictly necessary to install the development (*-devel) versions of these packages, practically all AI tools on Linux will require you to compile the tools from source if you are using ROCm. Therefore, you might as well get the full suite.\nTo verify ROCm functionality on your system, run rocminfo.

You can check and see if there is unofficial support somewhere, but it is unlikely.\nPriming ROCm on Fedora One last thing about ROCm that needs to be addressed on Fedora is that Fedora packages use directories that are not standard according to the ROCm project. This can and likely will cause problems when trying to set up AI tools, without it being obvious why.\nBy standard, ROCm development files come with copies of LLVM tools like clang and clang++ in /opt/rocm, which is what the tools expect. On Fedora, however, the ROCm packages do not do that. By running hipcc --version you can find out where the LLVM tools are, which should be located at /usr/lib64/llvm18/bin.\nWarning\nThe llvm18 part can change. Make sure you check your version first!\nBecause of this, you need to make symbolic links:\n/opt/rocm/llvm/bin/clang to /usr/lib64/llvm18/bin/clang /opt/rocm/llvm/bin/clang++ to /usr/lib64/llvm18/bin/clang++ This can be done with the following snippet:\nsudo mkdir -p /opt/rocm/llvm \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo ln -s /usr/lib64/llvm18/bin/clang /opt/rocm/llvm/bin/clang \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo ln -s /usr/lib64/llvm18/bin/clang++ /opt/rocm/llvm/bin/clang++ Now you should not be hitting into mysterious snags the way I have, as now there will be an /opt/rocm populated with the libraries and tools that are expected.\nVulkan It is not the end of the world if your GPU is not supported by ROCm, because it still can be supported by Vulkan or CLBlast. Vulkan is the same API that is used to play your favourite games on Steam on Fedora, and it can be used to do AI workloads as well. It is just not nearly as performant as ROCm. However, it is very much an attractive option, and still beats CPU-only inference by orders of magnitude.\nYou will need to install the following packages:\nsudo dnf install mesa-libOpenCL mesa-libOpenCL-devel libclc libclc-devel clinfo Similarly with ROCm, you can verify if your GPU is Vulkan-enabled by running clinfo. If you get a long list (as in the ROCm case above), then it means your GPU is recognised as a valid Vulkan platform. If you don\u0026rsquo;t see much, then it is not supported, but it really should be, unless you have exceptionally old or cheap hardware.\nCLBlast One thing to note is that Vulkan requires your CPU to have the AVX2 extension. This should be present on all modern CPUs, unless, as said, you have exceptionally old or cheap hardware. Should you not have AVX2 on your CPU for whatever reason, CLBlast is one last option that might be supported on your hardware, as it requires AVX instead. From what I understand, you will need the following:\nsudo dnf install clblast clblast-devel Just make sure to select a \u0026ldquo;CLBlast option\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;OpenCL option,\u0026rdquo; if one exists, whenever you use your AI tool of choice.\nIf your CPU does not even have the AVX extension, then you probably need to upgrade your hardware. However, it is worth nothing that version 1.82.4 of koboldcpp no longer requires AVX for its CLBlast backend, so your toaster can now run it.\nConclusion If this guide has helped at least one person, then my mission is complete. The information contained here took me at least a dozen hours of troubleshooting and frustration to gather \u0026ndash; probably more. The worst part is that some of it is still a bit unsure. My hope is that this page can become a small repository of Fedora-specific knowledge that other Fedora users can use to help each other, since getting AI to work on Fedora can be quite frustrating.\n","permalink":"https://maxwelljensen.eu/posts/ai_on_fedora/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eFedora is an awesome Linux distribution, but what makes it even more awesome is\nthe fact that you can run AI on it fairly easily.

Unlike static websites, which serve the same page every time someone visits, dynamic sites pull data from a database or other sources to create unique pages for each visitor.\nFor example, when you visit a blog powered by WordPress, the site dynamically pulls the latest posts, comments, and user information from its database to display a personalised experience. This ability to change content in real-time is why dynamic websites are used for e-commerce sites, social media platforms, and other websites where user interaction and fresh content are essential.\nHowever, for the vast majority of website concepts on the Internet, there is no need for all of that complexity and dynamic processing. Presumably, you are reading this guide in order to set up a personal blog, or some other simple website to that effect. Consider the following diagram:\nClearly this makes sense for something like Facebook or a phpBB forum, but if you are looking to set up a blog, then this is not the infrastructure to use. Yet WordPress is used for this purpose all the time \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s not at all necessary.\nOn the other hand, static websites are essentially files (like HTML, CSS, and images) stored on a server. When someone visits the website, their browser requests these files over the Internet and displays them for the user. Since there\u0026rsquo;s no need for server-side processing, static sites load quickly and are straightforward to maintain.\nWhy a static site over something like WordPress? One of the most compelling reasons to choose a static site generator is speed. Unlike dynamic websites, which generate content on-the-fly for each visitor, static sites are already on the server, waiting to be served.\nSecurity is another area where static sites shine. Since static sites don’t rely on server-side processing or databases, they are inherently less vulnerable to security breaches. There’s no login portal for hackers to exploit, and fewer moving parts mean fewer potential points of failure. In contrast, platforms like WordPress require regular updates and maintenance to patch vulnerabilities, which can be time-consuming and technically challenging for those who aren’t familiar with managing servers or databases. There\u0026rsquo;s just more headaches. You got a whole technology to learn, unlike static websites, which are just plain files on your filesystem.\nEfficiency is another key advantage of static site generators. Platforms like WordPress often require expensive hosting solutions with high resource limits. With a static site, you don’t need powerful servers because the heavy lifting is done during the initial build phase.\nSimplicity is another one. Gone are the days of dealing with complicated plugins, themes, and updates that are common with CMS platforms like WordPress. With Hugo, you don’t have to worry about PHP installations, MySQL databases, or server configurations. Instead, you focus on writing content and structuring your site in a way that feels natural to you. As said, it\u0026rsquo;s just files on your filesystem.\nFinally, static sites are often more SEO-friendly than their dynamic counterparts. Search engines love static content because it’s easy to crawl and index. Since there’s no complex code running in the background, your site can load faster and deliver a better user experience, both of which are important factors in search engine rankings. Additionally, many Hugo themes come with built-in SEO optimisations which search engines prefer.\nHow do you have a search bar? As you probably noticed, this website has a search function. Given this information, you might be inclined to think that this website is dynamic. What if I told you that this is not the case. \u0026ldquo;How is this possible?\u0026rdquo; you may ask.\nOn a static website, such as this one, the search function works differently from how it does on a dynamic website like WordPress. Since there\u0026rsquo;s no server involved to process your search query in real-time, the search is handled entirely by JavaScript running in your web browser.\nWhen you load this website, the JavaScript code along with the content and metadata of other pages is already embedded into the webpage. This means that the search functionality doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to send your request to a server; instead, it simply looks through the data stored in the JavaScript files on your local browser. When you type a keyword into the search bar, the JavaScript listens for your input and quickly scans through the stored content and metadata to find matching results. These results are then displayed on your screen without needing any server processing whatsoever. Lastly, this is all handled by the theme that this website implements; no manual work goes into this.\nUsing such creative solutions, it is possible to have features on a static website that are ordinarily found on dynamic websites. All this to say: static websites are far better than dynamic ones.\nNature of this guide In this guide, we will not be going through every single aspect of Hugo, since there\u0026rsquo;s plenty of resources available on this subject. Hugo documentation itself is beginner-friendly enough to be understandable to those who are new to the concept. Instead, we will go through some high-level basics for those who have never used a static web generator before, or even hosted a website before. That way, we can provide an adequate starting point to branch out from \u0026ndash; hopefully.\nIntroduction to Hugo Hugo is one of the most popular free software static site generators available today. It\u0026rsquo;s written in Go (a programming language known for its efficiency) and is very simple to use. Here are some key features:\nWorks on all platforms: Windows, macOS, and Linux. Plenty of themes: Hugo has a large ecosystem. As such, there\u0026rsquo;s many themes to choose from. Template-based design: Uses templates to define how your content will look. This makes it easy to customise themes, if you want to modify one you found, or to make one from scratch. Write in Markdown: Allows you to write content in Markdown, a lightweight markup language that’s easy to learn and use. No need for laggy WYSIWYG WordPress editors or other wheel reinventions. Looks something like the following: # This is a title Some text, and a list of things - List item 1 - List item 2 ## A header With some `code text` Note\nHugo is a command-line interface (CLI) program, which means that you need to interface with it using the terminal. On Windows, you will have to use PowerShell, which is not the same as Windows PowerShell. Command Prompt will not work.\nSetting up Hugo Hugo is a program, so we need to install it. It can be installed in different ways depending on your operating system.\nFor Windows users: Download the Hugo MSI installer from the official Hugo releases page and follow the installation instructions. Alternative ways of installing it may be found here.\nFor macOS users with Homebrew installed: brew install hugo For Ubuntu/Debian users: sudo apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt install hugo Warning\nHugo in the Debian respository is very outdated. It is recommended to manually install the binary from Hugo\u0026rsquo;s GitHub repository instead.\nFor Fedora users: sudo dnf install hugo Info\nHugo in the Fedora respository is slightly outdated. Some themes might depend on latest version of Hugo to work fully.\nOnce you have installed Hugo on your system, you can verify that it is installed by running hugo version in your terminal, which should give output like the following:\nhugo v0.143.1 linux/amd64 BuildDate=2025-02-04 VendorInfo=gohugoio Fundamentals of Hugo Hugo is one of those brilliantly simple solutions, that is so simple it might be difficult to understand, if one is familiar with all kinds of unnecessary and complex solutions.\nWhen you create a website using Hugo, you\u0026rsquo;re essentially telling it to take your raw content \u0026ndash; text files written in Markdown \u0026ndash; and combine them with templates, which define how your site looks, to build a complete, ready-to-publish website. Unlike platforms like WordPress, where every page is generated dynamically when someone visits your site, Hugo does all the work upfront when you run hugo build.\nBy compiling your site once and serving those static files, Hugo simplifies web development while offering the flexibility to create sophisticated websites. The workflow is always something like the following:\nEdit content Set up your posts, articles, documentation, or whatever in the content directory of your project, using your favourite text editor.\nCompile website Run hugo build, or just hugo, in your project. This process takes about 250 ms.\nDeploy website Deploy files from the public directory, where your complete website is contained, to your hosting service.\nFurther details on the basics of Hugo.\nUnderstanding the directory structure Hugo projects \u0026ndash; sometimes varying very slightly with the theme \u0026ndash; follow a specific folder structure that organises content, assets, and configurations logically.\nconfig.yaml: Configuration file for Hugo, which dictates project-wide functionality and behaviour. Hugo supports YAML, TOML, and JSON formats equally, though the general preference is for YAML. content: Where all your website\u0026rsquo;s content (posts, pages, etc.) reside. Inside are the files you actually edit to modify the content of your website. themes: Contains the theme directories you choose to use. assets: Holds static files that override static theme files, like CSS stylesheets. layouts: Custom template files if needed, which can override theme layouts also. If you have a file here called header.html, and if the theme implements one, then your header.html template will override the theme one. static: Static files for your content. If you have a file here called image.webp, you access it in content by calling /image.webp. public: The default directory where Hugo builds your site for production, but it can be changed with the --destination option. These files are not meant to be edited; they are the complete website. Understanding this structure is necessary in order for the website to compile properly, as Hugo depends on files to be in specific directories and subdirectories. More information on this can be found in the Hugo documentation.\nCreating your first website Let\u0026rsquo;s walk through creating a basic Hugo website, step-by-step.\nInitialise a new Hugo project Open your terminal/PowerShell and navigate to where you want to create your site. Run:\nhugo new site my-site cd my-site Add content Create your first page or post by running:\nhugo new posts/my-first-post.md This creates a Markdown file in the content directory. Open it in a text editor and add your content:\n+++ title = \u0026#34;My First Post\u0026#34; date = 2023-10-01 +++ Hello, World! This is my first Hugo post. The lines surrounded by +++ signs are known in Hugo as front matter. They contain metadata, define how a specific page should behave, and other things that might be relevant on a page-by-page basis.\nSelect and install a theme Most themes are hosted on GitHub, but you can find most of them here on Hugo\u0026rsquo;s website. Once you find one you like, use the links on the website to navigate to the theme\u0026rsquo;s repository and download it. You can either clone the repository using Git or download the ZIP file directly.\nDownload and place a theme in your themes directory. For example:\nmkdir -p themes/hugo-theme-bootstrap cp -R /path/to/theme/files/* themes/hugo-theme-bootstrap/ Update config.yaml:\ntheme: \u0026#34;hugo-theme-bootstrap\u0026#34; A lot of themes offer additional configuration options, such as colors or layout settings. Refer to the theme\u0026rsquo;s documentation for any specific requirements.\nBuild and serve the site In your terminal, run:\nhugo server This starts a local web server. Visit http://localhost:1313 to see your site. Or, if you used --bind=0.0.0.0, you can access it from other devices on your network. The site will recompile and show changes whenever you make changes to the files. This makes iterating upon the website very quick and easy.\nCustomise your site Modify the configuration files, add your own CSS/JS, or create additional content as needed.\nThe config.yaml (or .toml) file is where you set global preferences for your site:\nYAML title: \u0026#34;My Hugo Website\u0026#34; description: \u0026#34;A beautiful static website built with Hugo.\u0026#34; author: \u0026#34;John Doe\u0026#34; baseURL: \u0026#34;https://mywebsite.com/\u0026#34; languageCode: \u0026#34;en-us\u0026#34; timezone: \u0026#34;UTC\u0026#34; TOML title = \u0026#34;My Hugo Website\u0026#34; description = \u0026#34;A beautiful static website built with Hugo.\u0026#34; author = \u0026#34;John Doe\u0026#34; baseURL = \u0026#34;https://mywebsite.com/\u0026#34; languageCode = \u0026#34;en-us\u0026#34; timezone = \u0026#34;UTC\u0026#34; You can also configure settings like Disqus, social media links, etc., depending on the theme\u0026rsquo;s capabilities. More on project configuration here.\nUnless you are very unfamiliar with the CLI, in which case you may not be able to fully comprehend the above steps, you should have a fully functional website after following these steps.\nHugo\u0026rsquo;s documentation has a page on how to host on GitHub Pages. It is entirely free of charge, but you might also consider hosting fully independently like a landchad.\nWorking with templates What we covered is just the tip of the iceberg. Should you want to modify an existing theme, or even make a new one from scratch: Hugo uses Go templating language to help automate compiling content. You can modify templates in the theme directory or create custom layouts in your project\u0026rsquo;s layouts folder.\nFor example, to add a custom header:\n\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;{{ .title }}\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;header\u0026gt; \u0026lt;nav\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{{ .Site baseURL }}\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Home\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{{ .Site baseURL }}/about\u0026#34;\u0026gt;About\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/nav\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/header\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; More on this in Hugo\u0026rsquo;s documentation.\nAdding Custom CSS/JavaScript You can add custom styles and scripts by placing them in your theme\u0026rsquo;s assets directory or within your project\u0026rsquo;s assets folder. For example:\nPlace your custom.css in themes/your-theme/assets/css/. Include it in your layout template: \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026#34;stylesheet\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;{{ .themePath }}assets/css/custom.css\u0026#34;\u0026gt; Similarly, for JavaScript files: \u0026lt;script src=\u0026#34;{{ .themePath }}assets/js/custom.js\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; ","permalink":"https://maxwelljensen.eu/posts/websites_for_beginners/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eDynamic websites are websites that generate content on-the-fly, tailored to\neach user\u0026rsquo;s request.

Whether we like it or not, the fact is that anything we create or want to use is subject to copyright. Worst of all, legal illiteracy is a major issue in the free software sphere.\nThe amount of developers who do not understand licensing is staggering, and it has serious consequences; a lot of corporate exploitation. Developers after developers keep getting tricked.\nWarning\nTHIS ARTICLE IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE. I am not a lawyer, neither former nor currently practising. If you are uncertain about this topic, and valuable assets are at stake, come into contact with qualified legal counsel.\nCopyright The basis of licensing is copyright. If you wish to understand licensing, you need to understand the basics of copyright law. What is copyright? Encyclopedia Britannica defines it as follows:\ncopyright, the exclusive, legally secured right to reproduce, distribute, and perform a literary, musical, dramatic, or artistic work.\nNow commonly subsumed under the broader category of legal regulations known as intellectual-property law, copyright is designed primarily to protect an artist, a publisher, or another owner against specific unauthorized uses of his work (e.g., reproducing the work in any material form, publishing it, performing it in public, filming it, broadcasting it, or making an adaptation of it).\nIn summary, the goal of copyright is to protect the author of a work. The person who owns the copyright is called a copyright holder.\nHow is copyright established and put into effect? Historically, centuries ago, this used to vary by national jurisdiction. It was not guaranteed that a book author would have his creative work of art protected in every country. Today, however, most nations on the planet, including North Korea, are signatories of the International Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, or Berne Convention for short. Signatories of the Berne Convention constitute the Berne Copyright Union, which as of 2025 totals 181 nations.\nThe practical effect of the Berne Convention for the normal person is that the strictest possible copyright protection applies, by default, to any creative work they create. This means that if you write a book in USA, Germany, China, or any other of the Berne Copyright Union countries, all rights of the work are reserved to you, and nobody is legally allowed to derive from or distribute your work. This applies to software, musical composition, or any other work that the local jurisdiction considers \u0026ldquo;creative\u0026rdquo;. Violating copyright is called copyright infringement.\nThere exists an unfortunate but widespread pop myth: that lack of monetisation of derivative copyrighted work makes you immune to legal prosecution. This is wrong. It is still copyright infringement. If you create \u0026ldquo;fan art\u0026rdquo; of Warhammer 40,000 or Star Wars, not taking money for the work has no legal impact. Warhammer 40,000 and Star Wars are copyright of Games Workshop and Disney, respectively, and you are legally obliged to ask for permission from these copyright holders if you may create derivative work of their work. The only reason why \u0026ldquo;fan communities\u0026rdquo; of popular media franchises are allowed to operate is because they are a net benefit to the copyright holders. Fans create hype, and so it is sound business to let their copyright infringement slide. This strange symbiotic relationship has an unfortunate effect of distorting people\u0026rsquo;s understanding of copyright law.\nLicensing As you might imagine, reserving all rights for copyright to yourself is good, but it is not very useful without allowing others to see and maybe even distribute the work, in exchange for financial benefit to you. This is where licensing comes in. It allows us to make our project useful on GitHub, GitLab, Gitea, or any other git repository where others can pull the project and commit changes to it.\nAlthough film theatres do not own the copyright of Star Wars, they are still allowed to screen films, at least for a time, from the Star Wars franchise. This is because Disney is giving film theatre companies the licence to play the films. Usually this comes at a fee. Usually licences come with many terms that dictate what the licensee is allowed to do with licensed work. In this way, Disney allows the general public \u0026ndash; in a controlled way \u0026ndash; to consume their copyrighted work. Disney might stipulate that the latest Star Wars film shall be in theatres for only six months, or most of any other stipulation, as long as it is legally enforceable and not in violation of contract law.\nSoftware As explained earlier, when you create a work, all rights are automatically reserved to you, per Berne Convention. This includes software. Nobody is allowed to use your software without your explicit permission when you first create it. Licensing is a legal avenue of providing permission to others of when and how they may use your software. Therefore it is essential that you understand how to select and employ a licence for your program that makes it free.\nBefore we get to that, we should look at one last thing: free software versus proprietary software. Encyclopedia Britannica defines free software as follows:\nfree software, principle supporting the freedom of users to fully control their software. Software is considered “free” if it is offered by a developer without legal restriction against its study, redistribution, modification, or redistribution in modified form.\nThe promotion and propagation of free software is the chief aim of the free-software movement. The movement began in 1983, when programmer Richard Stallman announced his intention to create a free-software operating system named the GNU Project. Stallman went on to launch the Free Software Foundation (FSF) in 1985, an organization that remains a leading voice in the movement today.\nNote\nDisambiguation: \u0026ldquo;Open source\u0026rdquo; is often used as a synonym for free software, which is incorrect. To learn more, read \u0026ldquo;Why Open Source Misses the Point of Free Software\u0026rdquo; by Richard Stallman.\nNote\nThe word \u0026ldquo;free\u0026rdquo; in this context means freedom, not absence of price. When we talk about free software, we talk about software that respects freedom of the individual, for fair competition and transparency. The English language just has an unfortunate limitation, where the word \u0026ldquo;free\u0026rdquo; can mean two things. Often, in other languages, there is a difference between something being free and something being gratis.\nThe question of free software and proprietary software continues to cause controversy in the tech world. Proponents of free software claim that copyright law is outdated, and not fit for modern demands.\nNow, this page might read less like documentation and more like an essay on a blog, but we need to understand that law is not an exact science. At the same time, it is very much important when developing software. Therefore, we will have to get through some essay-like material before arriving at a conclusion that satisfies the technically minded.\nProprietary software Software that is proprietary, or closed source, cannot be modified and freely distributed. This is the most common type of software, since it is in line with the traditional ways of copyrighted work: reserving most of all rights, allowing access only for direct financial benefit.\nThis is understandable, but at the same time it poses philosophical and ethical questions. To take the most obvious example: Windows is the most widely used proprietary software on the planet. If you have Windows 10 installed on your computer, do you know what your computer is doing at any given time? No, because you do not have access to the source code of Windows 10. It is also doing not very good things, as illustrated by Edward Snowden, who exposed PRISM. Microsoft and many other large US-based tech companies forward information about you to the US federal government\u0026rsquo;s National Security Agency, or other intelligence agencies in the west. To many people that came as a shock, but to most proponents of free software it was exactly to be expected. Free software proponents are deeply distrustful of proprietary software for this reason, and many other reasons.\nThese concerns are entirely unique to software. Copyright law is on the side of Microsoft in spying on its users and even sending data to intelligence agencies without their consent. Songs, books, prose, newspapers, paintings, sculptures, and so on cannot spy on you. This is why the issue of software licensing is not just legally complicated, but also philosophically complex.\nFree software In contrast, free source software is software that can be freely modified and distributed by its users. You are entitled to view the source of the program, modify it, and distribute it however you desire, without restriction. Otherwise it is not considered free software.\nCompare this to proprietary software, which most of us understand intuitively, as part of growing up in an industrialised western society. You make a thing, you own it, and you are the sole proprietor of the thing. Private ownership is essential for a functional society, but this does not work with software. Depending on who you are, the reason might be confusing. In case you struggle with understanding why software should absolutely be free without any exceptions, it is recommended to read \u0026ldquo;Why Software Should Not Have Owners\u0026rdquo; by Richard Stallman.\nThis raises an obvious question: why make your software free? There are many reasons for why it is beneficial, even if it\u0026rsquo;s not immediately obvious why.\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t have to do everything yourself. Volunteer programmers will contribute to a free software project in exchange for absolutely nothing. Their sole incentive is seeing a project come to life that they think will benefit not just them but also others. It also tests their skill as a programmer, and allows them further work opportunities. Free software facilitates security. All serious private people, companies, and institutions that have need for cryptographic solutions will use only free software solutions. USA\u0026rsquo;s National Security Agency uses the Advanced Encryption Standard, or AES, to encrypt secret and top secret documents in the government. AES is open to the general public. Anybody is free to review and test AES for security errors. AES is therefore one of the safest cryptographic solutions in existence, as the entire planet has looked at the code and no errors have been found. Free software can be monetised. Common misconception of free software is that free software cannot be monetised. This is false. It is entirely possible to make software free, but ask for money in exchange for it. There are already a few major projects where this is done. DOOM: The code base of the game is free, but the art assets are still copyrighted and not free (both in price and freedom). You still have to pay for the art assets, in other words. Mindustry: The game is free, but you may purchase a licence of the game on Steam for additional features. Zrhythm: Free, but the executable files have to be paid for. This means that if you are sufficiently tech-savvy, you can simply compile the executable files yourself, and you skip the costs. Free software protects end-user rights. In most cases one is forced to use, and be dependent on, a producer\u0026rsquo;s continual support for a purchased product. For instance, if one purchases a Mercedes-Benz, it is likely that one will be forced to drive to the nearest Mercedes-Benz workshop if something breaks in the car. With free software, the end-user does not have just the possibility to solve software errors on their own, but also see if the software does exactly what it is supposed to do. With proprietary software this is usually impossible to verify. If something is wrong with proprietary software, you are at the mercy of the company behind the software. These are just some of the reasons why free software proponents choose to make their software free. You simply have to explore GitHub. It is the largest website for free software.\nFree software licences Contrary to proprietary licences, free software licences allow conditional access to the source code for everyone. Free software licences are applicable to all forms of media, but are typically used for software. The European Union maintains an interactive list of the various known free software licences. Here is a curated list of the three best licences that preserve the rights of both the author and end-users of their software:\nGNU General Public License v3 (GPL-3.0) Can: Use/reproduce, Distribute, Modify/merge, Commercial use, Use patents, Place warranty Must: Incl. Copyright, State changes, Disclose source, Copyleft/Share a., Include licence European Union Public Licence 1.2 (EUPL-1.2) Can: Use/reproduce, Distribute, Modify/merge, Commercial use, Use patents, Place warranty Must: Incl. Copyright, Royalty free, State changes, Disclose source, Copyleft/Share a., SaaS/network, Include licence Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL-2.0) Can: Use/reproduce, Distribute, Modify/merge, Commercial use, Use patents, Place warranty Must: Incl. Copyright, Disclose source, Copyleft/Share a., Lesser copyleft, Include licence There are a few legally acknowledged, or \u0026ldquo;correct,\u0026rdquo; ways of licensing a program. To learn more about that, read this. Information on that page is applicable to any other licence you use for software. If you follow the directions, your software should be legally protected. Make your licence as easily visible as possible, so that both end-users and abusers understand that your rights are protected.\nSoftware and present copyright law If you do not care about the particulars of licensing, and want to secure your software, using the licences mentioned above is enough. Otherwise, there are important issues to be known with how licensing of software works with today\u0026rsquo;s copyright law. As mentioned earlier, software is unusual as a medium, and copyright law was not designed to fairly process it \u0026ndash; fairly for the consumer, anyway.\nThe key to understanding free software licences is that they are an ugly jury-rig. A hack, if you will, of copyright law. It glues together modern demands of software and the Internet with old, rigid, outdated legislation from over one hundred years in the past. Here\u0026rsquo;s what that means:\nTechnically, the copyright holder of the Linux kernel is still Linus Torvalds. However, he, through the GNU General Public License 2.0 (GPL-2.0), allows conditional access to the kernel code. The biggest condition of the licence is that a person, who redistributes or performs a modification on the kernel, has to license his distribution or modification under the GPL-2.0 licence. In this way, all derivative versions of the kernel become licensed under the licence, because it is itself a licence term. This \u0026ldquo;legal virality\u0026rdquo; is how the kernel is legally protected, and retains its protection across all modifications. Where does Linus Torvalds as a copyright holder fit in this? That\u0026rsquo;s the thing: he doesn\u0026rsquo;t, at least not in any serious capacity. Him being a copyright holder is irrelevant, because the licence terms do not give him any special treatment. There is no clause that allows him to revoke licensed access to the kernel. The kernel is going to be free, forever.\nYet, he is required to be a copyright holder, because legally the copyright holder cannot be \u0026ldquo;nobody\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s simply a legal concept that does not exist in copyright law, as there was never a time in history where that was useful for any scenario.\nIdiotic licensing Not all licences are created equal, and you should be wary of certain ones. GPL-3.0, EUPL-1.2, and MPL-2.0 are the best, as they secure the largest amount of rights for both the author and the author\u0026rsquo;s end-users. There are, however, licences that do none of these things. Here\u0026rsquo;s a few of them, but the list is by no means exhaustive:\nApache License, Version 2.0 BSD Zero Clause License BSD 2-Clause \u0026ldquo;Simplified\u0026rdquo; License BSD 3-Clause Clear License MIT License What is wrong with these licences? The issue is rather simple: the terms of these licences do not include that all modifications of the software fall under terms of the same licence. What this means is that if one were to for instance take code licensed under MIT License, and perform modifications on it, one would be allowed to apply all modifications under any licence; regardless of whether they\u0026rsquo;re proprietary or not. This is what\u0026rsquo;s called a permissive licence, or idiotic licence, because it misses the entire point of making a software\u0026rsquo;s source open to begin with. Put another way, they are simply not free software. They do not fit the definition of free software.\nTo underline how catastrophically useless an idiotic licence can be, one should look no further than the story of Andrew Tanenbaum and his MINIX venture. MINIX is an operating system, and was licensed under some form of BSD licence and, to Tanenbaum\u0026rsquo;s utter obliviousness, was used by Intel in their Management Engine. The Management Engine, or ME for short, is a micro operating system that runs on any modern Intel CPU. Nobody knows what it does, and theoretically can be used by governments or sufficiently savvy hackers to steal cryptographic keys, or do other nefarious things no sane person would consent to. Intel was entirely justified in appropriating MINIX to build ME from. None of the terms in the BSD licence force Intel to reveal source, its modifications, or even license modifications under the same licence. Tanenbaum did not even know that MINIX was used for this purpose until several years after the fact.\nTanenbaum has been in personal conflict on this issue, since he got to know that MINIX is now world\u0026rsquo;s leading spyware. He regrets choosing an idiotic licence to license his software, but occasionally copes with the catastrophic, ill-advised decision as being inevitable:\nMany people (including me) don\u0026rsquo;t like the idea of an all-powerful management engine in there at all (since it is a possible security hole and a dangerous idea in the first place), but that is Intel\u0026rsquo;s business decision and a separate issue from the code it runs. A company as big as Intel could obviously write its own OS if it had to.\n–\u0026ndash; Andrew Tanenbaum\nTanenbaum is correct in that Intel would, at some point, write their own operating system to become hardware-level spyware on all of their products, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t change the fact that one person is responsible for the origin of ME: Tanenbaum. If MINIX had been licensed under, for example, GPL-3.0, Intel would have been forced to disclose source code of ME, all of its modifications, reveal Tanenbaum as the copyright holder, and many other important conditions. If Intel did not wish to face this immense legal liability, they would have been forced to spend their own cash, time, and manpower to develop a new, proprietary alternative. It would have been a lot of money, but, because of Tanenbaum, they were spared all of that. Very cool, Tanenbaum.\nAll in all, everyone who develops any kind of software has to avoid idiotic licences. MIT Licence is the most commonly used licence, which should speak for itself of how serious legal illiteracy is in software engineering. Do not make the same mistake, and pick an appropriate licence for your work.\n","permalink":"https://maxwelljensen.eu/posts/licensing_for_beginners/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe most fundamental, yet seriously overlooked aspect of any software is\nlicensing.
