      <description>&lt;p&gt;People with digital competence and creativity are in extraordinary high&#xA;demand. Many of today&amp;rsquo;s jobs will disappear, and far too few job applicants&#xA;have the knowledge and skills to cover the industry&amp;rsquo;s current and future needs.&#xA;Peopleâ€™s skill sets need to be developed, and education is the solution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Noroff is the premier academic institution in the Nordics for IT, both at&#xA;university and vocational level. In my time there, I have seen that there were&#xA;many capable teachers and students.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The educational Linux course</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During my tenure as tutor at Noroff vocational online school, I was tasked by&#xA;my team leader to recreate the Linux course &amp;ndash; part of the Network and System&#xA;Administration program &amp;ndash; in order to modernise it; make it more digestible for&#xA;students. The course I inherited, and went through myself as a student, was&#xA;getting crusty.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After close to &lt;strong&gt;eleven months of continuous work&lt;/strong&gt;, I managed to create a&#xA;five-week-long course, for full-time studies, that consisted of purely&#xA;original:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Internet Death</title>
      <link>https://maxwelljensen.eu/blog/internet_death/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Internet is a mega entertainment complex built on top of a graveyard of&#xA;meaning. Only Silicon Valley-approved content, opinions, and mechanisms may be&#xA;used to do anything on the Internet. I talk a bit about how the Internet has&#xA;been slowly choked out and how it is now dead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am not particularly old. BBS, Usenet, MUDs and other such 1990s constructs&#xA;were not part of my childhood, but I still got to explore some of the wild&#xA;Internet of the early 2000s. Practically speaking, it was like entering&#xA;international waters. Seemingly no rules applied, and no law held dominion.&#xA;This was the case for many years, far before the start of the 21st century,&#xA;although of course the Internet did not get substantially bigger until this&#xA;century.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Thoughts on Programming Languages</title>
      <link>https://maxwelljensen.eu/blog/programming_langs/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of programming languages, but often they are talked of in terms of what realistic applications they&#xA;have in the job market. Seldom is there prose about their quality as such; independent of their popularity and&#xA;application. Here&amp;rsquo;s some of my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;quality-versus-utility&#34;&gt;Quality versus utility&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As most software engineers know, there is not really any correlation between the quality of a language and its&#xA;popularity. There is however a correlation between popularity and utility. Python might not be the best language ever&#xA;made, but any design flaws it has are offset, in the eyes of most, by the fact that it has libraries for everything.&#xA;Why? Because it is in top three most popular languages, somewhere around C and Java. Therefore any issue one might&#xA;encounter probably already has a complete solution in the form of a third-party library. This means that Python has&#xA;extremely high utility, even if there are design issues with the language that can get in the way of common usage;&#xA;while writing code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
