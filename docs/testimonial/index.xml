      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is with great enthusiasm that I recommend Maxwell Jensen, an exceptional educator who&#xA;has made a positive impact on our Network and IT Security Administration program.&#xA;Maxwell joined Noroff as a student in 2021, where he distinguished himself through&#xA;dedication and excellence, earning his Professional Degree in Network and System&#xA;Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Under Maxwell’s leadership, the Linux course has become a favourite among students,&#xA;praised for its clarity, relevance, and accessibility. His ability to distil complex concepts into&#xA;engaging, student-friendly lessons reflects both his technical mastery and his commitment&#xA;to pedagogical excellence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started studying Network and System Administration through Noroff in January&#xA;2023, where I had the pleasure of meeting Maxwell Jensen. His dedication,&#xA;patience, and deep understanding of both the students and course material have&#xA;been truly inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have had the privilege of being guided by him through academic standards and&#xA;the complexities of the Linux software space, which many students find&#xA;challenging. His support has been invaluable not only to me but to my&#xA;classmates as well, many of whom would have ultimately struggled or even failed&#xA;without his guidance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
